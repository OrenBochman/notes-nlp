<p>This week I’m going to be talking about active learning and this is a follow-up to the data creation stuff that ellen talked about last time this is a very good tool uh because basically the thing that we’re kind of perennially uh faced with when we’re working with low resource languages is the lack of data and like ellen said having a little data is always better than having no data and but at the same time we really like to get it as efficiently as possible and active learning is a tool that allows us to do so so if we look at the different types of learning we have supervised learning where we basically have uh learning from input output pairs uh x and y we also have unsupervised learning where we learn uh from inputs only x uh or i guess you could also consider learning from outputs only like a like a language model or something like this semi-supervised learning we learn from both so that’s that’s great as well where active learning is querying a human annotator to efficiently generate examples usually generate xy examples from just uh inputs x and uh just to give an example if we’re talking about machine translation we might want to be generating translated pairs between a low resource language in english given only examples in the low resource language or only examples in english but we don’t want to be just randomly generating sentences we want to be re generating sentences that are most useful to create the translation system that we want so the way an active learning pipeline works basically we have labeled data um usually we start out with a little bit of labeled data like this this might be a very small amount of label data not enough to make a good system but enough to make a system that does you know something and based on this we do training we get our model and then we have a huge amount of unlabeled data we run this uh prediction system over all of this unlabeled data we do data selection of some variety we identify a set of examples that we would like to be annotating x prime we do annotation according to annotators and we generate more training data but we generate training data particularly of the variety that is uh useful uh most useful for creating the model and um the question about why we do active learning i can kind of be illustrated from this slide this is a very very simple uh two-dimensional classification problem uh where we have positive examples and negative examples uh and we would like to train a classifier that does well at separating the two um if we look at the example on the left the example on the left is our ideal situation of a high resource task where we have lots and lots of labeled data and uh based on this lots and lots of labeled data we train a classifier and the classifier achieves very high accuracy uh because it’s able to draw an appropriate decision boundary between the two however on the right side we have two examples the first example we randomly selected six data points and uh six data points we selected we then train a classifier and you can see the classifier is not a very good one it makes mistakes on some of the examples that we didn’t label which are shown in lighter in lighter colors however the one on the bottom right we selected particularly useful examples we only selected five so actually the amount of data that we labeled is smaller but nonetheless we’re able to draw a very good decision boundary here and uh and get you know 100 accuracy on the examples that we have now uh why were we able to do this can anyone look at these examples and tell me what the difference is between the ones on the top and the ones on the bottom any ideas the ones on the bottom are chosen near the boundary lines yes so that that’s a good example um maybe i could uh maybe i could do another okay this is not a particularly good um this is not a particularly good example uh to show this but let me show another another example where just choosing based on the boundary lines might not be sufficient so let’s say we have something like this so if we have an example if we have an example like this is uh is choosing on the boundary line sufficient maybe not necessarily right because we have this this portion over here where we have a whole bunch of things that are really close to each other but if we just drew it based on these examples here we might have another portion of the space over here where it’s not it’s not sufficient so um in addition to building things uh in addition to finding things that are on the boundary lines we’d also like to have a good idea of kind of what the shape looks like uh overall uh so these are two principles important principles in active learning trying to find things that are kind of hard to handle and trying to find things that give you a good idea of the shape of the data distribution overall so i will um i will talk about this uh going forward so these are the two fundamental ideas the first one corresponds to being close to the boundary lines so um uncertainty we want uh data that are hard for our current models to handle and another idea is representativeness we want data that are similar to the data um actually sorry that the what’s written on the slide is a little bit vague but basically we want data that are good representatives of the entire data distribution that we want to be handling um so i’d like to start out with the simple example of classification problems and within classification problems there’s a couple common paradigms for how we characterize the uncertainty of a classifier or something like this um so the first one is uncertainty sampling um the name is uh the name is kind of repetitive i guess corresponding to my uncertainty criterion up here but uncertainty sampling is basically finding samples where a particular model is least certain about its predictions there’s also something called query by committee which is also commonly used where query by committee basically uses different classification models and measures the agreement between them it’s kind of like the ensembling version of of uncertainty sampling and um then i kind of defined uncertainty in a vague way initially but there’s actually a lot of uh more rigorous mathematical criteria that allow you to do this um and here we’re talking about let’s say we’re talking about text classification or image classification or whatever else and in this case the first example that we can use is entropy and um because we’re talking about a classification task we have a small number of labels potential labels y and we can basically enumerate over all of them so we can directly calculate the sum uh p e of y given x uh times log of p of y given x so this is the kind of standard definition of entropy and the higher the entropy the more uncertain the model is about its predictions essentially another uh uncertainty sampling criterion that you can use is top one confidence and this is basically the log probability or the probability of the highest scoring output and basically you know even if you’re you’re not super certain about the distribution as a whole if you’re pretty certain that there’s a top one candidate that has like 75 accuracy and your model is reasonably well um calibrated so if you say 75 accuracy and actually the model gives you and actually then you get it right 75 percent of the time uh then this is also a pretty good criterion as well and then finally uh there’s a margin based criterion where basically you measure the difference between the top scoring value and the second to top scoring value and try to decide um try to find the ones where the difference between the top scoring value and the second to top scoring value are larger all of these are reasonable um different people have compared them and found different uh levels of utility i have done a lot of work on active learning and personally i like the third criteria and the best uh it seems to work most consistently well however it’s not probabilistic uh it’s not a directly probabilistic criterion so if you want to do kind of a more probabilistic view of active learning than some of the other ones like entropy might be better are there any questions about this year so you’re taking the arc max to find the top one scoring value first to find uh why that’s a good question but where y hat is basically the top scoring value and then we’re uh characterizing the confidence is top top one so the lower this value is uh the more uncertain you are for entropy the higher the higher the value is the more uncertain you are for margin the smaller the value is more uncertain you are okay um so there is also query by committee and basically [Music] does that mean that um if we want to do for instance not active learning but semi-supervised learning and we take those criteria in the contrary we will get rid of the like uh more uncertain values but then we say uh that all the values that are very certain are not useful to train the model yeah so semi-supervised learning is a tricky thing um for precisely this uh this reason and i think in particular you’re talking about self training um where self training basically what you do is you make predictions and then you use the predictions to train the model um in that case uh taking the more certain predictions is will give you cleaner data but it will also give you less useful data because the model’s already good at predicting them right so i think there’s essentially a sweet spot where it’s like you want to increase your threshold enough to get harder examples but not so much that the noise overwhelms the hard examples um the reason why the reason why self training works at all is because the model the models can essentially use some things to make predictions but then when you um when you update the parameters it’s also updating other other parameters which were not exactly the parameters that were used to make the predictions so um you could also think of you could also think of a self-training method where you i don’t know if actually anybody’s done this but you can think of a self-training method where you make confidence confident predictions but then you remove the evidence that was used to make the confidence predictions and force the model to like use other evidence that was not the like easy to parse evidence or something like that so um i think that but basically the the problem with self-training is that you’re um like you’re updating if you update the parameters which are the same ones that you use to make the decision then you’re going to always have this this issue any any other questions okay um so i’ll move on to query by committee um query by committee is also maybe a similar uh idea which is uh that you run multiple models and you measure the disagreement between the models um and the so for example you might train three or five models maybe they’re models with different architectures they’re models with different views of the data or something like this and the places where they disagree are the places where you’re less confident and you would thus like to label them to improve your accuracy this is similar to the uh to what i was talking about with the self-training question because uh they’re you know if you’re using here if you’re using different varieties of information to make the predictions then um essentially if one model is better at capturing certain traits than the other it might be it might be right the other might be wrong um and that gives you a good idea of the like confidence the models essentially um yeah and uh this can also be combined with other standard ensembling methods i i didn’t talk about those uh in this class so i’ll just skip over that point um so now we have uncertainty methods uh whether you get the uncertainty from kind of a probabilistic method or a margin based method or query by committee so that handles uh identifying the examples that are hard for the model um the second uh core idea in active learning is representativeness and there’s a reason why this is really important um and the reason why is because if you don’t have any idea of representativeness um basically active learning will just go and find all of the outliers in your training set and ask you to go and label them uh ask a human annotator to go in and label them and this is a problem because like i’ve actually done active learning on text classification and other stuff like this and you’re trying to classify between uh hockey and baseball for example hockey based social media posts and baseball based social media posts and it gives you like dollar sign dollar sign dollar sign dollar sign uh is the thing that you’re supposed to be labeling and obviously that’s not going to be very useful because it’s an outlier it’s not really belong to either of the classes it’s just garbage so um in order to overcome this we want to find examples that are representative of our whole training set while being uncertain and then the question is how can we classify examples as being similar to many other examples and in simple feature vectors the easy way to do this is to find vectors that are similar to others in vector space and this is an example from a very famous uh early paper on active learning for neural network based image classification models where basically they um they took the vectors from a pre-trained uh image classifier and clustered them together uh and this this is just a visualization in two-dimensional space probably using like disney or another visualization method but what you can see is if you sorry this is red and green which are the two colors that you’re not supposed to use if people are uh colorblind but um like the uh basically what you can see is the uh here the red is the data points that are sampled by an active learning model and you can see that an uncertainty based active learning model basically samples a lot of points from some part of the space but very few points from other parts of the space whereas if you consider representativeness and also sample from places that are similar to other vectors in the space you make sure that you get um you get them spread out all over the place um so this is a very simple way to do this in um nlp or something like this we have lots of methods to turn sentences into vectors for example like we have sentence for we have uh some cse or whatever else so these methods here are applicable uh to some extent uh to like representing sentences or maybe maybe words for example so this would be a first uh way to think about representatives um there are some other ways though uh that are applicable specifically to text and i’m going to be talking about those next um any questions about this okay so um if we think about prediction paradigms for language tasks uh there’s lots of different ways we can do it um one is text classification uh you know we take in a sentence uh we output a label another one is something like tagging where we take in a sentence and output uh one label for each uh token in the input sentence and another one is sequence to sequence uh which is you know empty or speech recognition or whatever else and each of these requires a different uh strategy for active learning um there’s some overlap but they can use different strategies so if we look at sequence or token level prediction problems um basically for sequence labeling in sequence to sequence we can do annotation at different levels so sequence labeling is what i call tagging here a sequence sequence so one way we can do it is we can do labeling at the sequence level so we can annotate the whole sequence and the other way we can do it is at the token level so we can annotate only a single ambiguous thing within the sequence and how many people here have done any sort of annotation for structured prediction tasks for nlp like um but let’s say okay shinji raising his hand um okay uh and uh ner labeling would be an example an er labeling is actually an interesting example because um it’s very sparse annotation but let’s say you want to do labeling for part of speech tagging or a translation a translation i would also say counts as this it takes a long time to label a sentence uh accurately so translating a whole sentence um for me to translate a whole news sentence from japanese english probably takes two or three minutes however translating a single word from japanese to english probably takes me about 10 seconds so given that labeling a whole sequence you know does take a lot longer than individual tokens within a sequence yeah so given you use this in a practical scenario need to go through the same sentence if the same example is picked up for the token level option yeah so that’s a good that’s a good uh question so in a practical scenario wouldn’t a annotator have to go through the same sentence again and again um if the same sentence is picked up for multiple labels the answer is um yes and no uh in most active learning scenarios you often assume you have far more input sentences than you’re able to label in the first place um i’m also going to talk about another method that considers this a bit later so i’ll get back to that um any any other uh questions or there are also some efforts on this unaligned labeling where you just give uh sequence level tags for even token level information and use the pointer networks to map them so oh sequence level tags for token level information you mean like basically you use the sequence sequence model to solve this problem or yeah mainly for cases like uh tax lot value cases like slot filling in er cases when it’s very sparse so you’re just giving information at the sequence level and you expect the network to learn the yeah um i i think that is uh that’s reasonable i think i still would say that’s something like token level annotation here uh in terms of the human effort required to do the annotation um cool so a token level makes it possible to just annotate difficult parts of the sentence which potentially could give you some time savings but it requires strategies to learn from individual uh like parts of the sentence um so first i’ll talk about sequence level uncertainty measures um so when we unlike text classification we can’t just take the entropy of a single label over uh the entire text um and somehow we need to combine a sequence of structured predictions into a single uncertainty measure to get which sequences you want to be labeling um so in terms of top one confidence this is a this is trivial to apply to sequence labeling tasks and the reason why the reason why is because even if we have a structured prediction task um we can still take the arc max of the output sequence using beam search or some other thing like this and calculate the log likelihood of this output so um in terms of top line confidence still the this log probability of the highest scoring output would be our top one um so this is not hard this is not hard to apply here um margin we can also do something similar so you can take the top one output the second output you can do a beam search with uh you know a beam size of at least two and get the top two scoring outputs and find the difference between them also you can do sequence level entropy this is non-trivial to enumerate all of the sequences obviously because you can’t enumerate all of the possible translations for an output but you can enumerate the 10 that like the top and best and calculate your entropy over that as well and that will give you a better idea if you have uh like a non you know uh a lot of peakiness in the distribution um that you’re outputting or uh or not very much um and also um i’d like to note that this reference down here has a very clear exposition of this uh it’s a paper a paper from a long time ago in 2008 but it’s very clearly described and you can read more details there um are there any questions for the time being though okay okay so now yeah sure so um basically what it would look like is um uh it would be it would look like this just like the entropy over labels but where y is a sequence and now you can’t enumerate you can’t enumerate over every possible sequence but you can get an invest from beam search or something and then enumerate over there um uh in terms of sequence level uncertainty measures i actually have worked more on token level active learning so i’m not as familiar with like which one works uh works the best overall but my impression is that they’re pretty they’re pretty similar but um like i’ve seen more people use top one confidence maybe just because it’s a lot easier to it’s like simpler conceptually cool um so now moving to training on the token level um the way this works is um uh we would like to train on partial data so basically we want to train on data that’s been annotated for some part but not the whole thing um for uh if we’re using an unstructured predictor for something like sequence labeling this is easy it’s uh it’s basically trivial to do so like let’s say we are taking in bert and based on the representations we are doing independent predictions of part of speech tags for every word in the sequence what we do is we basically calculate the loss function over this verb annotation here and we don’t calculate the loss function over the others so it’s it’s very very simple uh almost trivial to do so that’s good news um for other more complicated things um we didn’t really talk about uh conditional random fields or other things like this very much in this class here um but basically for any uh any method that we use to do analysis that requires some sort of a dynamic program over the output uh there are ways where you can do the dynamic program over only the uncertain parts of the output and uh and calculate the log likelihood uh based on that so that’s a possibility too uh if this sounds interesting to you you can read uh this paper uh training conditional random fields from incomplete uh annotations so um actually i think i didn’t mention this in the slides um but i think it’s an important thing so i think a lot of people are also going to be interested in things like machine translation and machine translation it used to be that you would be able to do things like annotate a part of the sentence and use only that part of the sentence to extract a phrase table uh in phrase-based machine translation so in france-based machine translation people uh basically if you remember from the unsupervised translation class i talked about it there you would extract a phrase table that showed you how to translate individual phrases and then you’d reorder them using a language model and other things like that there it was relatively simple to uh learn from like individual annotations because you would just throw them into your phrase table and use that as additional phrases however for neural mt now it’s much more difficult because we’re learning over full sequences and we actually have a paper that we just published last year called phrase level active learning for neural machine translation i’m very creative title obviously um that shows you how you can do things like this and basically we tried a whole bunch of different things like one thing is you can just take the labeled partial phrases for machine translation and put them directly into your training data another thing you can do is you can like swap them into sentences and do data augmentation and other things like that so if you want to find the details we have a number of uh methods that we talk about uh that we talk about in this paper as well so um this is just an empirical paper where we try a lot of a lot of things so if you’re interested in mt you can take a look there too cool um so any any questions about that okay great so then the next question is token level representativeness metrics um and actually um one of the issues with active learning especially using pre-trained representations is if you have a um a poor representation learning model because you don’t have enough data to train it on like for example a low resource language the representations that you use to calculate your representativeness metrics might not be that great in the first place so one thing that we’ve actually found is just considering like token similarity uh is actually a pretty sorry token identity is a pretty reasonable proxy with respect to um like representativeness in the early stages of active learning so for example you could accumulate the uncertainty over all instances of a particular token and use that as how necessary it is to annotate that token so just to give an example um when you’re accumulating when you’re accumulating your uncertainty like let’s say your entropy over x you might accumulate the entropy over all um all examples where x is uh corresponds to a token run and or uh in this example x corresponds to a token like so what that would say is in part of speech tagging i’m not very certain about the part of speech for the word like so i want you to annotate more examples of uh of the word like basically and um that’s particularly good for things like part of speech tagging or machine translation or something like that where you might have some words that are really easy to guess the part of speech of um or the translation of and some words that are are quite difficult because they’re polish on this or something like this so this would be um entropy um but it could be to make it more general i could make this uh uncertainty you know you have some sort of uncertainty metric and you accumulate that uncertainty metric over all words where the word identity is it could be the entropy it could be the top one um it could be the top one probability it could be the margin or something like that yeah and uh then after you do that you need to select a representative instance of that token um there’s a number of different ways you could do this you could pick the example that’s most uncertain out of all the examples of that token other things that we tried to do for part of speech taking for example is try to choose examples where one part of speech tag was predicted or the other and the idea being that that would give you examples of like like uh that would give you examples of um run as a noun and run is a verb because run can be both a noun and a verb uh especially if you live in pennsylvania where every small river is called a run um cool uh so the next thing is sequence sequence uncertainty metrics um uh there’s a bunch of different things both on the sequence level and on the token level um an example of a bet a sequence level is back translation likelihood and uh one uh the way you would calculate this is you might get your one best uh translation on the output side and then you would calculate the probability of the input given that one best translation so it’s basically uh you use your mt system to generate uh the output and then you calculate the score of the input given that and let’s say you do a really really bad translation if you do a really bad translation you’ll have a lot of trouble recovering the original sentence and because of that your back translation likelihood will be low so you can go in um another example which isn’t even based on the model but is actually very very effective um and also very easy to apply i’ve used it a lot is finding the most frequent uncovered phrases in your training corpus so this is based solely on um representativeness and on a very like weak uh notion of uncertainty but the basic idea is um you you count up the frequency of all of the phrases in a big monolingual corpus that you don’t have translated and then you also calculate the frequency of all of the um of all of the phrases in your translated corpus and you find the highest scoring um the highest scoring phrase x-bar in your monolingual corpus um where the frequency of x-bar in your bilingual purpose is equal to zero or you know below a threshold or something so the idea being that you’ve never seen it in your translated data but you see it a lot in your monolingual data and that will pick up things like names of famous politicians you know um brand names uh phrases from social media other things like this um and then you can take these you can add them to your data and your model will be able to uh translate them and this is an example of uh how i present these or how this is not my paper but this is how um they presented them and how i presented them when i i was doing active learning for translation uh basically you uh take the phrase and you present it in context so you highlight the uh highlight the phrases yellow and then you ask them to translate only that phrase but they get to see the surrounding context so they have an idea of like what the phrase means and if it’s a very strange phrase like you know you get half of uh half of a grammatical constituent or something like that it will um uh they’ll also be able to say i can’t translate this on its own because i don’t have the appropriate context highlighted or something cool um any questions about this part yeah for the back translation yeah you basically need two models for this um you need a for model and a backward model or you can train a single model that can go in both directions but um cool so cross-lingual learning plus active learning um so cross-lingual learning plus active learning i think is a really powerful combination because one of the big issues with active learning is when you don’t have a good model in the first place but cross-lingual learning gets you a long way uh there like our zero shot methods you know are are really quite good uh out of the box but they’re not anywhere near as good as supervised methods so we take a zero shot method and we adapt it using active learning and um this is an example from a paper by aditi who just uh presented two times ago um where basically we we showed that the combination of token level active learning and cross-lingual transfer is just like much better than any of the two in isolation um and you can start out with like the green line here is just active learning um the blue line here is active learning blue orange and some of the other lines are active learning plus cross-lingual transfer and you can see that like right at the very beginning uh cross-lingual transfer helps you start out at a at a good space and this is for named entity recognition cool um so one other thing that i’d like to talk about is active learning is very attractive you know it’s like um uh for a very small number small amount of the data annotation you get a much better system um but one thing that you should remember is that uh you know when people are actually doing annotation uh things are not quite as simple as it may look in like a simulation so for example in simulation it’s common to assess active learning based on the number of words or sentences annotated any ideas why this is uh maybe a little bit unrealistic let’s start with sentences so um you in uh and actually one thing i should mention is when we do active learning it’s very common to draw these graphs which is like amount of annotated data on the x-axis and the accuracy on the y-axis so let’s say this x-axis was based on the number of annotated sentences from your purpose for machine translation or something like that yeah exactly so different sentences might be different lengths so let’s say your active learning system decides to pick all of the 400 word sentences in your corpus to annotate of course it will do very well because you’re getting you know the average sentence is 20 so if it picked the 400 length sentences then you’d be getting 20 times the training data for the same like quote-unquote price um what about words does that seem realistic better maybe but still you know some words are harder to translate than others like i can blow through a lot of translation of just kind of uh you know standard let’s say conversational text um but if i start doing news i need to look up what uh the vice kernel of the third battalion of the ukrainian army is or how to transliterate all the russian and ukrainian names that i’m seeing in the news now um into japanese uh which is not easy right so uh those words will take me a lot more time than um like uh than something else and especially if it’s the case where i’m uh not uh you know an expert in the field uh one interesting thing though is a lot of translators do charge you by the word so uh until they figure out uh that you’re giving them really hard sentences it probably actually won’t the cost will be the same across words so you know you might burn a lot of good will with your translator if you give them like adversarial essentially adversarial examples uh but um like at least uh some translation services it will be you know a fixed price so in that case it’s actually reasonable to have words on your accent um another thing is there’s a higher chance of human error for these hard things so um you know like even if the price is the same they might make more mistakes yeah so this is an interesting paper from your group last year about the models pay the right attention and you had human annotators as well annotate what parts of the corpus they are looking at attention and modern attention so how much time did that take for them to as well okay yeah so there was a question we um basically we had a paper last year where we annotated not only or where we basically asked people to choose between two translations and annotate their um annotate like their rationale for doing that um they didn’t actually translate in that case that case they were just choosing between two words um so that’s a much easier task like um it’s a it’s basically a word level disambiguation task instead of a translation task um so it’s a little bit hard to say how much longer it would take to annotate rationales but i think um another really important thing that i don’t know if i mentioned it here is uh ui is extremely important uh for annotation tasks um ellen pointed that out a little bit when we were talking about brat and other things and i think if you have the appropriate ui and you give like people are working with the appropriate kind of uh i don’t know directions or interface it might actually not take that much longer to annotate a rationale um another thing is uh one one interesting thing is um actually for a lot of people when they’re browsing the web where they move their mouse corresponds to where they’re looking at so you might actually even be able to get these kind of things for free by watching where their mouse moves um another thing that people have done is they’ve strapped translators into eye trackers and asked them to do eye tracking while they were translating to see where they were paying attention to in things like this um the problem is uh that won’t be super easy to do um you know not not for every translator maybe for some uh portion of particularly like nice translators or maybe maybe if you could get like one of the recent vr headsets like the oculus rift or something like that uh you could do uh something so i think um so the answer is it’s complicated uh but with some creativity you might be able to get like extra annotations like rationales or other things like that with like less effort than you would if you had to do it like um uh in a different way so yeah i think that’s like a very great idea for like a very long document translation so so they are translating also saying which part of the document they’re focusing on have like a generalized ui framework for them to translate and also like highlight portions of what they’re looking at i think this could be a generalized framework for uh sequence yeah that’s a that’s a really good point um so i don’t immediately have the references here and it would take me a little time to look them up but there was somebody in holland or somewhere else that did like pretty extensive eye tracking experiments with uh translators so i think uh this is definitely an interesting topic and if you could use that to supervise attention or other things like that that’d be pretty cool like this was a single word and if you were to translate the whole sentence you would actually increase your human translation time so you have to be careful because if every word is like you have to look at the document and annotate particular rationale there’s like a single word you would have to pay a lot of money for other players so this case it worked because it was a single word but it’s unclear if this would be feasible if you were to do the whole translation just this is the point yeah but it so another another thing to note is you can actually do a pretty good job of uncovering rationales through alignment but it would be kind of cool to see if there was a way you could get like natural annotations to um to kind of like improve alignment or something else like that through eye tracking or whatever else and one thing i didn’t cover at all here in active learning is there’s the concept of like natural annotation or incidental annotation or things like this which is basically annotations that you get for free uh due to some other features so another example of that might be um websites where the websites are translated and then you have links where the link definitely goes around the words that mean the same thing and the two websites and you can use that to like extract alignments and other things like that so um that’s a very interesting thing that i’m not covering in this class but yeah good ideas okay so um because uh the cost might not be the same in active learning uh there are methods to consider cost in active learning um so uh there’s uh an older concept called proactive learning uh that basically considers different oracles that cost different amounts for each um and uh so for example um that might be something like hiring a professional translator versus hiring a crowd translator where we know the professional translator would do a better job but would cost more um another thing is cost sensitive annotation and um this is a uh this is an example of this uh this was a paper that i i did together with um matthias berber who’s a phd student i was working with at the time and basically this is for speech recognition transcription and the idea is that you want to create better transcriptions and you have different modalities with which you can um with which you can annotate you can either re-speak so re-speaking is basically saying the thing again um in a clearer voice where the like asr system is more likely to get it right you can also skip so like not annotate it or you can type and typing takes the most time but it’s the most the most certain and um so then uh you create a model of how much each one is going to cost and this model can be updated on the fly as you annotate more data and then you also create a model of how much this will improve your results which can also be updated on the fly where you have the data and then you take the two models you predict how much annotating each span would help and then you run a uh like optimization algorithm to find the set of things that would uh do the best and to get back to the question that we had before what if you had multiple tokens in the same sentence that uh required you to go like from one sentence go to a different sentence come back this model explicitly takes into account the cost of context switching so a span that’s contiguous will cost less to annotate than annotating each of the individual words in uh together so this is another way you can model things like this another thing to think about is reusability of active learning annotations so when is the best study to start doing active learning annotations is it after every epoch or um so i think that’s a good question and i think there’s a number of things that go into this i think um theoretically there’s some theory on active learning and theoretically the best thing to do is to annotate basically like recalculate every time so retrain the model every time you get a training example an update uh the problem with this is uh two-fold number one computational so it’s hard to update the model that quickly between when an annotator is working number two actually annotators will that kind of gives the annotators whiplash where you show them like one example then immediately they have to like look at a different example that they weren’t able to look at whereas normally when you’re annotating you can like read you know several sentences or something like that mentally prepare yourself for doing the annotation um so in reality almost always you do some sort of batching strategy uh where it’s like you you annotate ten sentences and update the model or a hundred sentences and update the model um but i think theoretically updating after every example is like supposedly the best from an ml perspective cool and i think this is the last thing um reusability of the active learning annotations so the annotations that you get from an active learning model uh depend on the model itself so especially if you’re talking about uncertainty um the uncertainty for different models will be different so if active learning annotations are obtained with one model they may not transfer well to other models and this is just an example um from a model uh from a nice paper uh called practical obstacles to deploy active learning and basically the idea is if you sample um blue is random sampling and here this is a svm based active learning method and the red line is an svm based model and you can see the svm based active learning method is doing relatively well um so is the cnn based active learning method um if you look at a cnn based model on a movies on the same data set you can see that basically all of the active learning methods are are similar the cnn based active learning method is better but the active learning method based on other models is basically the same as random and then if you look at the lstm on the same data set the lstm based active learning method is like maybe marginally better than random sampling maybe about the same but the cnn and svm based active learning methods actually produce data that’s worse for training the lsdm based model so because of the kind of mismatch between the models that were used to do active learning and the models that were used to train the active learning models uh this causes uh issues so one of the methods that i one of the methods that i introduced today might be able to remedy this particular problem uh does anyone want to remember back to the beginning of the class what’s a good active learning method for leveraging multiple models query by committee yes so query by committee might be able to solve this because you would use all three of these models and find where they disagree and those would be the places that you would want to be sampling but nonetheless the fact that you’re not sampling directly from the data distribution but sampling from some kind of bias distribution that’s vaguely related to the data distribution means that it’s not necessarily the case that you would train a model and it would do well uh in the future so it’s something to be aware of and be careful of but nonetheless um there are also methods that are completely model agnostic like for example sampling the most frequent phrases for machine translation um and so i i don’t think this is a reason to throw out active learning it’s just something to be you know aware of yeah this is like across different types of models but now that it’s just the competition of different language models uh you’re probably going to have a less costly language model helping you with the active learning part so how much is the difference of impact across different language models yeah i think that’s a good question it really boils down to whether the examples they find hard are similar or different um i don’t have a good idea of whether that is more or less different with the language models that we have now my my intuition is that probably it won’t change a huge amount but it may even be more different because now all the pre-trained language models are trained on different data whereas in this particular experiment all the models were trained on the same data so um also one thing this is just completely an aside but it’s an important thing to know anyway which is um in pre-trained language model in pre-trained language model literature people often focus very much on the methods they use as opposed to the data they train on but the data they train on is actually probably more important so um i mentioned much earlier in the class that ember tends to be better on like knowledge based tasks whereas roberto tends to be better on kind of like analysis or identification tasks oh sorry xlmr tends to be better on analysis or identification tasks and this is my conjecture is that this is because ember is trained on wikipedia whereas roberta xlmr is trained on like a whole bunch of other data um and so i i think that will also carry over into you know reusability of active learning uh annotations as well i implemented active learning in my base company so we used like word and sentence word to help so sentence burt was helping with the uh samples and then the birth model with the classification had to do the actual downstream task and the other challenge was how do we do it across languages like when we have like cross-legal modular texts on robota for doing like cross-lingual internal classification when you’re doing active learning with five annotators in five languages then it’s i guess little more challenging so then we use like multilingual sentence embeddings across my languages so yeah so that’s why i was like curious whether that method is right yeah and i i think like as i mentioned query by committee you know using different models uh finding places where all models are uncertain is probably you know a safer bet than finding places where one model is highly uncertain another model is uh not very certain other things like this so i don’t know if there’s like correct answers to any of these and there are some empirical questions in general how much newly annotated data do you need to make a difference how much newly annotated data do you need for it to make a difference to the model very small amount a very small amount um yeah so in this example it’s 400 tokens to get a 10 percent gain in parts in ner accuracy um that’s not very much that that would take you an hour or something um if you’re doing random sampling those 400 tokens would get you a gain of about one one or two points it depends on how good the model is in the first place original data set size um other things like this but i think the the nice thing about active learning is the beginning of the curve is really steep um especially if you’re using a good method uh that considers representativeness because um like for example zero shot zero shot transfer across languages will do like really really silly things like missing missing the name of the country that the language is from like it it will it will um in yoruba it will have nigeria be like an organization or something like that um or something and those are the things that you get in the first like 200 tokens you annotate basically cool um so i think you had mentioned that uh you had you had a paper on language model calibration for question tasks where you you mentioned that the model it’s high quality for a long answer as well so will that be a problem when we use rp learning for the uh uh maybe question answering tasks with a large language yeah so calibration um so did we i forget did we talk about calibration in this class advanced yeah we talked about it in advanced nlp maybe not here but basically to give an overview calibration is um how well the probability distributions predicted by your model associate with the probability of the answer actually being correct so in a well calibrated model if the probability if the confidence that the model says is 80 it will be correct about 80 of the time if the confidence it gives is 40 it will be correct about forty percent of the time um uh a poorly calibrated model will say it’s uh eighty ninety percent confident and get it right twenty percent of the time or say it’s twenty percent confident and get it right ninety percent of the time so that’s a bad calibration calibration is actually pretty important in some cases for active learning um it’ll be less important for things like margin based methods or other things that are not as clearly probabilistic but we do have a paper on um active learning for part of speech teching where we show that by improving calibration you can get like pretty significant gains and how well active learning works so yeah it’s it’s good yeah cool um so the final thing is the discussion question and um the discussion question is given the task in language or languages that you’re tackling in your project how could you use active learning to improve um how would you calculate uncertainty how would you calculate representativeness and how would you ensure annotator productivity so uh we can split into do we have six yeah we have we have enough for six groups so cool</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>Here is a lesson outline on active learning, based on the sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to Active Learning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Active learning is a technique that strategically queries a human annotator to generate labeled examples from unlabeled data.</li>
<li>It is especially useful in low-resource scenarios where data is scarce.</li>
<li>Active learning aims to generate the most useful examples to efficiently train a model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Types of Learning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Supervised learning: Learning from input-output pairs (x, y).</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning: Learning from inputs only (x).</li>
<li>Semi-supervised learning: Learning from both labeled and unlabeled data.</li>
<li>Active learning: Efficiently generating labeled examples (x, y) from inputs (x) by querying a human annotator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Active Learning Pipeline</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start with a small amount of labeled data.</li>
<li>Train a model using the labeled data.</li>
<li>Apply the model to a large amount of unlabeled data.</li>
<li>Select the most informative examples from the unlabeled data.</li>
<li>Annotate the selected examples.</li>
<li>Incorporate the newly labeled data into the training set and retrain the model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Why Active Learning?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Active learning can achieve high accuracy with fewer labeled examples compared to random sampling.</li>
<li>By selecting the most useful examples, active learning can create a better decision boundary with less data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Ideas of Active Learning</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: Select data that the current model finds difficult to handle.</li>
<li><strong>Representativeness:</strong> Choose data that are representative of the overall data distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty Sampling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty sampling involves selecting samples where the model is least certain about its predictions.</li>
<li>Common criteria for uncertainty sampling include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Entropy</strong>: Higher entropy indicates more uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Top-1 Confidence</strong>: Lower top-1 confidence indicates more uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong>: Smaller difference between the top two candidates indicates more uncertainty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Query by Committee</strong>
<ul>
<li>Query by committee involves using multiple models and measuring the disagreement between their predictions.</li>
<li>Train multiple models with different architectures or views of the data.</li>
<li>Areas where models disagree are considered less confident and are good candidates for labeling.</li>
<li>Query by committee can be combined with standard ensembling methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Representativeness</strong>
<ul>
<li>Representativeness ensures that the selected examples are similar to the overall data distribution.</li>
<li>Without representativeness, active learning may focus on outliers, which are not helpful for training a generalizable model.</li>
<li>Methods to determine representativeness include finding vectors that are similar to others in vector space.</li>
<li>Techniques like sentence embeddings can be used to represent sentences as vectors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Active Learning Strategies for Text Prediction Tasks</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different prediction paradigms for language tasks include text classification, tagging, and sequence-to-sequence tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sequence/Token Level Annotation</strong>
<ul>
<li>For sequence labeling and sequence-to-sequence tasks, annotation can be done at different levels: sequence-level or token-level.</li>
<li>Token-level annotation allows focusing on the most difficult parts of sentences, potentially saving time.</li>
<li>However, token-level annotation requires strategies to learn from individual parts of the sentence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sequence-level Uncertainty Measures</strong>
<ul>
<li>Top-1 confidence: Straightforward to apply to sequence labeling tasks.</li>
<li>Margin: Calculate the difference between the top-1 and top-2 scoring outputs.</li>
<li>Sequence-level entropy: Enumerate over n-best candidates to approximate entropy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Training on Token Level</strong>
<ul>
<li>For unstructured predictors, each prediction can be treated as independent, and training can be done only on annotated labels.</li>
<li>For structured prediction methods, marginalization can be used to sum over all unlabeled tokens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Token-level Representativeness Metrics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Accumulate uncertainty across token instances to identify tokens that need more annotation.</li>
<li>Select a representative instance of that token for annotation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sequence-to-sequence Uncertainty Metrics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sequence-level: Back-translation likelihood can be used as an uncertainty measure.</li>
<li>Phrase level: The most frequent uncovered phrases in the training corpus can be selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cross-lingual Learning + Active Learning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Combining cross-lingual learning with active learning can improve performance compared to using either technique in isolation.</li>
<li>Cross-lingual transfer helps to start at a better initial state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Active Learning and Human Effort</strong>
<ul>
<li>In simulations, active learning is often assessed based on the number of words or sentences annotated.</li>
<li>However, in reality, active learning may select harder examples that take more time and have a higher chance of human error.</li>
<li>Simulations often overestimate the gain from active learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Considering Cost in Active Learning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proactive learning considers different oracles that cost different amounts for each annotation.</li>
<li>Cost-sensitive annotation creates a model of annotation cost and accuracy gain for each span in different modes.</li>
<li>The best spans and modes are chosen based on this model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reusability of Active Learning Annotations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Active learning annotations obtained with one model may not transfer well to other models.</li>
<li>The bias in the data distribution due to active learning can cause issues when training different models.</li>
<li>Query by committee, which leverages multiple models, may help to mitigate this problem.</li>
</ul></li>
