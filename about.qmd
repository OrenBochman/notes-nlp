About this blog

1. Course notes
  - In many cases the original notes are sparse
  - It might be best to add the video transcript in a collapsed callout to the notes. This can then allow using RAG on the whole lesson in a single page.

    - If transcripts are included, it is best to split them using titles which contain a question which the speaker is answering.
    - Also it is a good idea to link to the slide being shown if this is available.
