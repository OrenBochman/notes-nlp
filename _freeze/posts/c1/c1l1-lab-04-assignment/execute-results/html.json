You will learn about logistic regression. Concretely, you will be implementing logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will: \n* Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text\n* Implement logistic regression from scratch\n* Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task\n* Test using your logistic regression\n* Perform error analysis\nWe will be using a data set of tweets. Hopefully you will get more than 99% accuracy.  \nRun the cell below to load in the packages.\n## Import functions and data\n\n::: {#23aa894f .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# run this cell to import nltk\nimport nltk\nfrom os import getcwd\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Imported functions\nDownload the data needed for this assignment.

If you took the Deep Learning Specialization, we referred to the weights with the `w` vector.  In this course, we're using a different variable $\\theta$ to refer to the weights.\nLogistic regression\n$$ h(z) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp^{-z}}$$\n$$z = \\theta_0 x_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + ... \\theta_N x_N$$\nWe will refer to 'z' as the 'logits'.\n### Part 1.2 Cost function and Gradient\nThe cost function used for logistic regression is the average of the log loss across all training examples:\n$$J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)}\\log (h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log (1-h(z(\\theta)^{(i)}))\\tag{5} $$\n* $m$ is the number of training examples\n* $y^{(i)}$ is the actual label of the i-th training example.\n* $h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction for the i-th training example.\nThe loss function for a single training example is\n$$ Loss = -1 \\times \\left( y^{(i)}\\log (h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log (1-h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) \\right)$$\n* All the $h$ values are between 0 and 1, so the logs will be negative. That is the reason for the factor of -1 applied to the sum of the two loss terms.\n* Note that when the model predicts 1 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 1$) and the label $y$ is also 1, the loss for that training example is 0. \n* Similarly, when the model predicts 0 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 0$) and the actual label is also 0, the loss for that training example is 0. \n* However, when the model prediction is close to 1 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 0.9999$) and the label is 0, the second term of the log loss becomes a large negative number, which is then multiplied by the overall factor of -1 to convert it to a positive loss value. $-1 \\times (1 - 0) \\times log(1 - 0.9999) \\approx 9.2$ The closer the model prediction gets to 1, the larger the loss.\n\n::: {#28eb01e2 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# verify that when the model predicts close to 1, but the actual label is 0, the loss is a large positive value\n-1 * (1 - 0) * np.log(1 - 0.9999) # loss is about 9.2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```\n9.210340371976292\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* Likewise, if the model predicts close to 0 ($h(z) = 0.0001$) but the actual label is 1, the first term in the loss function becomes a large number: $-1 \\times log(0.0001) \\approx 9.2$.  The closer the prediction is to zero, the larger the loss.\n\n::: {#8615399d .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# verify that when the model predicts close to 0 but the actual label is 0, the loss is a large positive value\n-1 * np.log(0.0001) # loss is about 9.2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\n9.210340371976182\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Update the weights\nTo update your weight vector $\\theta$, you will apply gradient descent to iteratively improve your model's predictions.  \nThe gradient of the cost function $J$ with respect to one of the weights $\\theta_j$ is:\n$$\\nabla_{\\theta_j}J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m(h^{(i)}-y^{(i)})x_j \\tag{5}$$\n* 'i' is the index across all 'm' training examples.\n* 'j' is the index of the weight $\\theta_j$, so $x_j$ is the feature associated with weight $\\theta_j$\n* To update the weight $\\theta_j$, we adjust it by subtracting a fraction of the gradient determined by $\\alpha$:\n$$\\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha \\times \\nabla_{\\theta_j}J(\\theta) $$\n* The learning rate $\\alpha$ is a value that we choose to control how big a single update will be.\n## Instructions: Implement gradient descent function\n* The number of iterations `num_iters` is the number of times that you'll use the entire training set.\n* For each iteration, you'll calculate the cost function using all training examples (there are `m` training examples), and for all features.\n* Instead of updating a single weight $\\theta_i$ at a time, we can update all the weights in the column vector:  \n$$\\mathbf{\\theta} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\theta_0\n\\\\\n\\theta_1\n\\\\ \n\\theta_2 \n\\\\ \n\\vdots\n\\\\ \n\\theta_n\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n* $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ has dimensions (n+1, 1), where 'n' is the number of features, and there is one more element for the bias term $\\theta_0$ (note that the corresponding feature value $\\mathbf{x_0}$ is 1).\n* The 'logits', 'z', are calculated by multiplying the feature matrix 'x' with the weight vector 'theta'.  $z = \\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{\\theta}$\n    * $\\mathbf{x}$ has dimensions (m, n+1) \n    * $\\mathbf{\\theta}$: has dimensions (n+1, 1)\n    * $\\mathbf{z}$: has dimensions (m, 1)\n* The prediction 'h', is calculated by applying the sigmoid to each element in 'z': $h(z) = sigmoid(z)$, and has dimensions (m,1).\n* The cost function $J$ is calculated by taking the dot product of the vectors 'y' and 'log(h)'.  Since both 'y' and 'h' are column vectors (m,1), transpose the vector to the left, so that matrix multiplication of a row vector with column vector performs the dot product.\n$$J = \\frac{-1}{m} \\times \\left(\\mathbf{y}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{h}) + \\mathbf{(1-y)}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{1-h}) \\right)$$\n* The update of theta is also vectorized.  Because the dimensions of $\\mathbf{x}$ are (m, n+1), and both $\\mathbf{h}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are (m, 1), we need to transpose the $\\mathbf{x}$ and place it on the left in order to perform matrix multiplication, which then yields the (n+1, 1) answer we need:\n$$\\mathbf{\\theta} = \\mathbf{\\theta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\times \\left( \\mathbf{x}^T \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{h-y} \\right) \\right)$$\n<details>    \n<summary>\n    <font size=\"3\" color=\"darkgreen\"><b>Hints</b></font>\n</summary>\n<p>\n<ul>\n    <li>use np.dot for matrix multiplication.</li>\n    <li>To ensure that the fraction -1/m is a decimal value, cast either the numerator or denominator (or both), like `float(1)`, or write `1.` for the float version of 1. </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n::: {#6815dd08 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# UNQ_C2 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)\ndef gradientDescent(x, y, theta, alpha, num_iters):\n    '''\n    Input:\n        x: matrix of features which is (m,n+1)\n        y: corresponding labels of the input matrix x, dimensions (m,1)\n        theta: weight vector of dimension (n+1,1)\n        alpha: learning rate\n        num_iters: number of iterations you want to train your model for\n    Output:\n        J: the final cost\n        theta: your final weight vector\n    Hint: you might want to print the cost to make sure that it is going down.\n    '''\n    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###\n    # get 'm', the number of rows in matrix x\n    m = x.shape[0]     \n    for i in range(0, num_iters):\n        \n        # get z, the dot product of x and theta\n        z = np.dot(x,theta)\n        \n        # get the sigmoid of h\n        h = sigmoid(z)\n        \n        # calculate the cost function\n        J = -1./m * (np.dot(y.transpose(), np.log(h)) + np.dot((1-y).transpose(),np.log(1-h)))                                                    \n        # update the weights theta\n        theta = theta - (alpha/m) * np.dot(x.transpose(),(h-y))\n        \n    ### END CODE HERE ###\n    J = float(J)\n    return J, theta\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#47863451 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Check the function\n\n# Construct a synthetic test case using numpy PRNG functions\nnp.random.seed(1)\n\n# X input is 10 x 3 with ones for the bias terms\ntmp_X = np.append(np.ones((10, 1)), np.random.rand(10, 2) * 2000, axis=1)\n\n# Y Labels are 10 x 1\ntmp_Y = (np.random.rand(10, 1) > 0.35).astype(float)\n\n# Apply gradient descent\ntmp_J, tmp_theta = gradientDescent(tmp_X, tmp_Y, np.zeros((3, 1)), 1e-8, 700)\nprint(f\"The cost after training is {tmp_J:.8f}.\")\nprint(f\"The resulting vector of weights is {[round(t, 8) for t in np.squeeze(tmp_theta)]}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe cost after training is 0.67094970.\nThe resulting vector of weights is [4.1e-07, 0.00035658, 7.309e-05]\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n/tmp/ipykernel_386898/190191251.py:32: DeprecationWarning:\n\nConversion of an array with ndim > 0 to a scalar is deprecated, and will error in future.
