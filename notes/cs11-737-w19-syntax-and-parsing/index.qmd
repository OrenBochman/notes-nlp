## Navajo in 10

*   **Language Name and Classification**:
    *   **Navajo** (also known as **Navaho**).
    *   Navajo: *Diné bizaad* [tìnépìz̥ɑ̀ːt] or *Naabeehó bizaad* [nɑ̀ːpèːhópìz̥ɑ̀ːt].
    *   It is a **Southern Athabaskan language** of the **Na-Dené family**.

*   **Speakers and Location**:
    *   Spoken primarily in the **Southwestern United States**, especially in the **Navajo Nation**.
    *   One of the most widely spoken **Native American languages**.
    *   The most widely spoken Native American language north of the **Mexico–United States border**.
    *   Almost **170,000 Americans** speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.

*   **Nomenclature**:
    *   The word *Navajo* is an **exonym** from the Tewa word *Navahu*, meaning 'large field'.
    *   The Navajo refer to themselves as the *Diné* ('People'), with their language known as *Diné bizaad* ('People's language') or *Naabeehó bizaad*.

*   **Official Status**:
    *   Official language in **Navajo Nation**.

*   **History and Development**:
    *   The Apachean languages, of which Navajo is one, are thought to have arrived in the American Southwest from the north by 1500.
    *   Speakers of the Navajo language were employed as **Navajo code talkers** during World Wars I and II.
    *   Orthography developed in the late 1930s and is based on the **Latin script**.

*   **Writing System**:
    *   Based on the **Latin script**.
    *   Developed between 1935 and 1940.
    *   Uses an apostrophe to mark **ejective consonants** and mid-word or final **glottal stops**.
    *   Represents nasalized vowels with an **ogonek** and the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative with a **barred L**.

*   **Phonology**:
    *   Has a fairly large **consonant inventory**.
    *   **Stop consonants** exist in three laryngeal forms: aspirated, unaspirated, and ejective.
    *   Has a simple **glottal stop** used after vowels.
    *   Four **vowel qualities**: /a/, /e/, /i/, and /o/.
    *   Each vowel exists in both **oral and nasalized** forms and can be either **short or long**.
    *   Distinguishes for **tone** between high and low.

*   **Grammar**:
    *   Relies heavily on **affixes**, mainly prefixes.
    *   Affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult to segment.
    *   Basic word order is **subject–object–verb**.
    *   Verbs are conjugated for **aspect and mood**.

*   **Vocabulary**:
    *   Most Navajo vocabulary is of **Athabaskan origin**.
    *   Has been conservative with **loanwords** due to its highly complex noun morphology.
    *   Expanded its vocabulary to include Western technological and cultural terms through **calques and Navajo descriptive terms**.

*   **Revitalization and Current Status**:
    *   **Bilingual Education Act** in 1968 provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers.
    *   Navajo Nation Council decreed in 1984 that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the Navajo Nation.
    *   **Navajo-immersion programs** have cropped up across the Navajo Nation.
    *   Diné College offers an associate degree in the subject of Navajo.
    *   In December 2024, Navajo Nation President made Navajo language the official language of Navajo Nation.
