        "In this ungraded lab, we will implement a popular metric for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text: the BLEU score proposed by Kishore Papineni, et al. In their 2002 paper [\"BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation\"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1040.pdf), the BLEU score works by comparing \"candidate\" text to one or more \"reference\" translations. The result is better the closer the score is to 1. Let's see how to get this value in the following sections.\n",
