The input corpus in this week's assignment is a continuous text that needs some preprocessing so that we can start calculating the n-gram probabilities.

Some common preprocessing steps for the language models include:
- lowercasing the text
- remove special characters
- split text to list of sentences
- split sentence into list words

Can we note the similarities and differences among the preprocessing steps shown during the Course 1 of this specialization?

```{python}
import nltk               # NLP toolkit
import re                 # Library for Regular expression operations

#nltk.download('punkt')    # Download the Punkt sentence tokenizer 
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

### Lowercase {#lowercase}

Words at the beginning of a sentence and names start with a capital letter. However, when counting words, we want to treat them the same as if they appeared in the middle of a sentence. 

We can do that by converting the text to lowercase using [str.lowercase]
(https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.lower).

```{python}
#| scrolled: true
# change the corpus to lowercase
corpus = "Learning% makes 'me' happy. I am happy be-cause I am learning! :)"
corpus = corpus.lower()

# note that word "learning" will now be the same regardless of its position in the sentence
print(corpus)
```

### Remove special characters {#special-characters}

Some of the characters may need to be removed from the corpus before we start processing the text to find n-grams. 

Often, the special characters such as double quotes '"' or dash '-' are removed, and the interpunction such as full stop '.' or question mark '?' are left in the corpus.

```{python}
# remove special characters
corpus = "learning% makes 'me' happy. i am happy be-cause i am learning! :)"
corpus = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9.?! ]+", "", corpus)
print(corpus)
```

Note that this process gets rid of the happy face made with punctuations :). Remember that for sentiment analysis, this emoticon was very important. However, we will not consider it here.


### Text splitting {#text-splitting}

In the assignment, the sentences in the corpus are separated by a special delimiter \n. We will need to split the corpus into an array of sentences using this delimiter. 
One way to do that is by using the [str.split](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split) method.


The following examples illustrate how to use this method. The code shows:
- how to split a string containing a date into an array of date parts
- how to split a string with time into an array containing hours, minutes and seconds 

Also, note what happens if there are several back-to-back delimiters like between "May" and "9".

```{python}
# split text by a delimiter to array
input_date="Sat May  9 07:33:35 CEST 2020"

# get the date parts in array
date_parts = input_date.split(" ")
print(f"date parts = {date_parts}")

#get the time parts in array
time_parts = date_parts[4].split(":")
print(f"time parts = {time_parts}")
```

 This text splitting is more complicated than the tokenization process used for sentiment analysis.


### Sentence tokenizing {#sentence-tokenizing}

Once we have a list of sentences, the next step is to split each sentence into a list of words.

This process could be done in several ways, even using the str.split method described above, but we will use the NLTK library [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) to help us with that.

In the code assignment, we will use the method [word_tokenize](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktLanguageVars.word_tokenize) to split your sentence into a list of words. Let us try the method in an example.

```{python}
# tokenize the sentence into an array of words

sentence = 'i am happy because i am learning.'
tokenized_sentence = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
print(f'{sentence} -> {tokenized_sentence}')
```

Now that the sentence is tokenized, we can work with each word in the sentence separately. This will be useful later when creating and counting N-grams. In the following code example, we will see how to find the length of each word.

```{python}
# find length of each word in the tokenized sentence
sentence = ['i', 'am', 'happy', 'because', 'i', 'am', 'learning', '.']
word_lengths = [(word, len(word)) for word in sentence] # Create a list with the word lengths using a list comprehension
print(f' Lengths of the words: \n{word_lengths}')
```

The previous result produces a list of pairs. This is not equivalent to a dictionary.

## N-grams {#n-grams}

### Sentence to n-gram {#sentence-to-ngram}

The next step is to build n-grams from the tokenized sentences. 

A sliding window of size n-words can generate the n-grams. The window scans the list of words starting at the sentence beginning, moving by a step of one word until it reaches the end of the sentence.

Here is an example method that prints all trigrams in the given sentence.

```{python}
def sentence_to_trigram(tokenized_sentence):
    """
    Prints all trigrams in the given tokenized sentence.
    
    Args:
        tokenized_sentence: The words list.
    
    Returns:
        No output
    """
    # note that the last position of i is 3rd to the end
    for i in range(len(tokenized_sentence) - 3 + 1):
        # the sliding window starts at position i and contains 3 words
        trigram = tokenized_sentence[i : i + 3]
        print(trigram)

tokenized_sentence = ['i', 'am', 'happy', 'because', 'i', 'am', 'learning', '.']

print(f'List all trigrams of sentence: {tokenized_sentence}\n')
sentence_to_trigram(tokenized_sentence)
```

### Prefix of an n-gram

As we saw in the lecture, the n-gram probability is often calculated based on the (n-1)-gram counts. The prefix is needed in the formula to calculate the probability of an n-gram.

\begin{equation*}
P(w_n|w_1^{n-1})=\frac{C(w_1^n)}{C(w_1^{n-1})}
\end{equation*}

The following code shows how to get an (n-1)-gram  prefix from n-gram on an example of getting trigram from a 4-gram.

```{python}
#| scrolled: true
# get trigram prefix from a 4-gram
fourgram = ['i', 'am', 'happy','because']
trigram = fourgram[0:-1] # Get the elements from 0, included, up to the last element, not included.
print(trigram)
```


### Start and end of sentence word $<s>$ and $</s>$ {#start-end-of-sentence}

We could see in the lecture that we must add some special characters at the beginning and the end of each sentence: 

* $<s>$  at beginning
* $</s>$ at the end

For n-grams, we must prepend n-1 of characters at the begining of the sentence. 

Let us have a look at how we can implement this in code.

```{python}
# when working with trigrams, we need to prepend 2 <s> and append one </s>
n = 3
tokenized_sentence = ['i', 'am', 'happy', 'because', 'i', 'am', 'learning', '.']
tokenized_sentence = ["<s>"] * (n - 1) + tokenized_sentence + ["</s>"]
print(tokenized_sentence)
```

That's all for the lab for "N-gram" lesson of week 3.
