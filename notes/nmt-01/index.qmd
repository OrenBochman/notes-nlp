In 2020 Roee Aharoni gave a course on Neural Machine Translation at Bar Ilan University. 

This are some notes on the first lecture in the series

Lets imagine we have come into contact with good and bad aliens. We have a small parallel corpus of good alien's languages AND the bad alien's languages.

We start by asking if we had a small parallel corpus of good aliens languages how would we learn to translate between them?

1. We have $S^g_i \to S^b_j$ a translation mapping.

we want to extend this mapping
