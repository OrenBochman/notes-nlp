<!-- Transcript here is machine generated no punctuation and I eddited it a but but it needs more work and I dont see the benefits unless I can run it through some tool. -->

### Introduction

> I'm gonna run through this um we have about half an hour um i'm
gonna talk about all languages on the planet um basically not not um
not too big um and of course there are a lot of languages and the question really
is how can we try to structure that space we could look at them
directly um but we'd like to be able to gather them into groups or similarities and
that's where we come up with a more um organized structural way and we call
this linguistically and typology and so there is official ways to try to
find out similarities between language and that's what we're going to talk about in this um
in this form so let's have a look so first we've got all the languages in the
planet we have a dot here and for each of the languages now um this is very
hard to do because languages are not point they're spread over multiple places and of course they're spread over
multiple places that um will overlap as well but you can see something about here
that there are some places that seem to have more languages per you know square inch um than others
and it seems to be the the richer countries the ones where there's a common education system travel
is very easy and they have a long history of fighting each other with borders you're more
likely to find languages that cover whole what would we we call countries while um
when we're looking at places that are um been around for a very long time but
might not have the same definition of border and there's more languages and sometimes these languages are related to
each other and sometimes they're not sometimes they're from rival groups and sometimes they're just
not related like korean is not related to any of the other languages in the area and there's some relations to
japanese but it's really the japanese and korean are not like anything else
and therefore they're more like each other but only because they're not like anything else in the area at all um even
though both of them have got some substantial chinese influence with words and english influence as well
um what's the definition definition of a language uh well that's sort of quite hard and
there's different definitions and we basically are coming down to um whoever defines it but of course it
become can become quite political we've talked about these things before uh urdu
and hindi different languages well it depends what you're talking about from a political point of view unquestionably
from a linguistic point of view yeah they're sort of different from a phonological point of view they're not
very different at all they really pretty much overlap um and we have lots of examples like that

### Defining Languages

> There is the standard joke but it's a good joke and it's very relevant and that is "a language is a dialect with an army" and there certainly is political decisions when it comes to defining what
the border actually is between two languages and often it's quite weak between two languages and people can
float between one and the next um so depending on the area depending on the

history depending on the politics depending to on the historical aspect of um ethnic
groups and travel etc um defining what the languages actually are um is still
pretty uh um hard but say in the in india there is something like about 460
languages which is a lot officially from the government i think it's 21 if i
remember correctly and which is about the same size as what europe is when it comes to official
languages but of course as you look closer um you discover that you start getting
distinctions between languages which might be relatively small but they might be very big to the extent that these
people absolutely can't understand each other but there may be many people who speak multiple languages remember it's
really only uh um america and britain um where people only speak one language and
only one language so it's pretty rare actually in the world that people are only speaking one language

### Language Families

> There are different language families and so linguists have decided looking at
languages especially looking at things like um where choice and a word overlap
which might vary between languages but there might be relationships between languages that we can see language
families that are actually sharing um information like um
lexicons so the choice of the word um the grammatical aspects the morphology
act actually even though there could be differences they might be more similar and so across africa we can see
something like regions of about um six different major language families
and you know we can see that geographical aspects madagascar is different but that's because you know
there's a big sea between that in the mainland and that actually makes less um chance for
interaction to happen and therefore it's sort of easier to keep that um distinction so you find sometimes that
languages have got borders that are quite um geographical mountains rivers um and the sea of course
### Online Languages

> How many of these languages are online um we're all very aware that both
you know um english european languages chinese japanese korean are very well
represented online and how many people within the country are actually getting online nowadays often
many of the richer people are online and they can be quite substantial amounts of uh data online but also when you look at
um a major areas of wealth that have computers that have internet often there
may be mixed languages and there may be a preferred language you often discover that in india even though there are lots
of different languages in india that are native that people who are online are often using english or they're writing
in the romanized form rather than their native script because well history etc
it's easier they're fluent in english um there's a lot of english influence that's actually there china almost
everything is written in putonghua stands mandarin even though there are many other dialects there so there's not
the same representation across everywhere because it depends on whether these people have access and that
they're willing to talk in these languages often they consider these to be spoken only or rarely written and so
their language of literacy is some colonial language be that english and spanish french etc or swahili or
arabic um but it might be that it's just easier for them to do that and therefore there's a tradition
to be able to communicate in um one of the standard larger languages on
the planet rather than their own language and so when we're trying to do multilingual nlp we're actually caring
about these smaller languages that may not be as much online okay so how do we try to find similarity

### Similarity

> between languages well obviously the the clearest thing is what we can do is we can start looking at the words and so we
can see whether there's a shared information and we usually look for words not like iphone and computer that
are relatively modern we look at words that have been in the language for a long time so this
is often body parts um family relationships um core food
aspects water air etc and there's actually a specific list called the um
swabish list which you can be often used to compare um similarities between um
languages now you want to be a little careful about caring about the writing systems so often that there's a writing
system that writes things in a very different way but you may discover that there's actually a shared information um
between the language in the phonetic form that's not there in the written form and
therefore you can't just use string match to find out whether it actually works or not um
there's a number of online um groups that try to identify all of the languages on the planet um ethnologue is
one of the best to try to do that it actually comes out the summer institute of linguistics which is a religious
organization which is caring about translation of the bible but they're quite independent in in doing their list
mostly and um it's definitely the most comprehensive list in in the world glottalog tries to do a
similar thing but it also is identifying um this the position of the language on
the planet and that's not the only influence to similarity because people get on boats and cross oceans
and uh we're currently in the united states and um we all know in this particular area um
english is not um native at all and french is native no no french was there
before english was there but there was earlier indigenous languages definitely iroquois and possibly a
language called mingo um is somewhat native and though the name allegheny is probably a mingle word for probably it's
a word for river um maybe northern river because it's the northern one in the
obvious three rivers um but um glottalog tries to do this but
also gives downloadable um spreadsheets that allow you to be able to do um a in
other aspects now remember people move i mean huge populations have moved around the planet which has influenced how
languages have moved and also trade has done a lot to have shared
aspect of languages as well as grammatical history or linguistic
history of languages and we want to be careful about that when we look at that distribution um you know one might think that if you
go to take the example of um korean there are lots of english words in korean they
have a different pronunciation from the english but they're clearly derived from english but that doesn't mean that there's any linguistic relationship
between korean and english it's much more to do with um english being the
international language of the last hundred years um and korea has picked up many of these more modern words um into
its language because that's a convenient way to do it um

### Genealogical similarities

> genealogical similarities so this is the language family and this is usually divine defined by linguists who make
decisions about looking at the linguistic properties historically we used to do this in the animal kingdom
before we could do dna tests and there are interesting errors in the dna tests
for animals that two animals have come from different family and moved together because that's a convenient co-evolution
to end up with a different way but actually they're quite got different histories but that might not be obvious and that's going to happen with
languages as well where things end up being borrowed maybe things get simplified over time we can see some
examples of this but things also get more complex over time and there's lots of interesting and boring from some of
the major families that are out there niger congo in africa has got a lot of different languages and covers 21
um of the languages spoken on the planet that's a lot okay well if we look at
something like indo-european that covers most of europe not all of europe and through
um the middle east at least the northern middle east m
iran and into northern india and that's a lot of people okay but it's only about
6.3 of the languages because many of these languages are spoken by a very large number of people so you're going
to get very large numbers of people and also some of the links between languages that although you know german and
english have lots of common lexical items that people can sort of work out
and if they know english or they know german and be able to work out what the other one is but sometimes it's not
immediately obvious that there's a relationship between the languages and very few of the words are actually
overlapping lithuanian which is sometimes identified as the one that's most
archaic in the sense of it's got more of the history of the original part of Indo-european and so does english but the relationship is not obvious at all to an english speaker

### Typological similarities

how do you work out these typological similarities well this is one of the major things that linguists have been doing for a long time and they've been
looking at ways of linguistic properties to try to see what the similarities are
between them and there's a number of books and studies that try to collect that information together from multiple
research studies okay now when we're looking at um phonology so the actual
pronunciations the ipa is an excellent way for being able to split down the
possible ways that most languages on the planet actually do their pronunciations and we
have a vowel space that's continuous vowel space and we split each language splits it into different ways and
there's often drifts between different languages that are maybe even um predictable for consonants and things
which are not vowels that's probably the best definition of them um there's lots of things about um a place of
articulation in manner of articulation places where we put constrictions from the front of the mouth down to the back
of the throat and we can sort of have things that deal with the lips with things like p and b things that deal
with the teeth things like tea and things that deal with just behind the teeth which are things like um
okay and all of these may have different variations depending on the um
a on the languages that we're actually speaking and have different distinctions in english we may produce some of these
but we don't make distinctions between them but for example um a korean has got
um three different p's that most english speakers would not distinguish between
so when we're looking at similarity between languages we could look at the similarity in the phonology and how many
phonemes actually are um common between the different languages now um there's actually a group called

### Walls

walls now walls is also on a collection of all of these different typographic
variations um that are uh um a over all
of the languages and basically back in the early 2000s um a group of people tried to start collecting papers um and
showing what the similarities so for the most part you can go to the walls and a
website you can select some particular feature and you can see the distribution here we've got the distribution of the
planet of different number bases so we all count um in all languages some more
than others and um sometimes we use decimal and it's probably related to the fact the number of fingers that we have
but some count in twenties um and that's not really unusual even in english we
have some residual twenties that's there and even in chinese there's some religious
um uh 20-ness where we have a specific word for 20 in english it's score um and
here's a mapping of all of the languages now we're not saying that these languages are related to each other
we're saying that when we look at numbers all of the languages with the blue dot um are um
counting in decimal basically well those for example that are in the purple pinkish dot are counting in twenties
across and some don't have good ways of doing that um at all now walls is this excellent
detailed form where you can go through and find different things you can find out which languages refer to t as t and
which refers to it is chai which is quite interesting in itself some of them are
maybe a little bit light-hearted and some of them are quite detailed like for example um a word order or a default
word order of um in english we have a subject verb um object japanese is um a subject object
verb now historically um walls originally came in a book okay and this
book is what's called really really big and i'm sorry i had to take it from underneath my monitor um
because it normally keeps my monitor at the right level but the book of course isn't updated but the website is and
over the years the website gets more and more and people now actually think about registering the piece of work that
they're doing to be able to cover what's actually there now not everything is in walls
um because not all of the features have been studied in all of the languages most
linguists are going to study something that's interesting so if they're interested in something like
voicing inconsonants after long vowels that's only going to be interesting in some languages and other languages
there's just nobody's going to study that and so the question is can we actually predict the missing feature
from other factors because often there's information that's in there so for example in linguistics um default word
order seems to be less fixed when you have more morphology and that's
something to do with um if you've got morphology it allows you to be able to identify who did what
to whom better and therefore you don't need to care about word order in the same importance level so there's some
predictable things so if somebody tells me something about a language i don't know and says it's a really rich
morphology i i'll think maybe it's got free word order that's not true for everything but there's a more likelihood
that it does if something doesn't have lots of um morphology it probably has
more fixed order and can we learn this from the data by
looking at all of the features all of the languages find the missing ones make predictions hold out the ones we do know
and it may allow us to be able to make these predictions and lots of people have tried to do that at various um
levels and being quite successful and in fact the paper that we asked you to look at already has looked at some how well
some of these predictive things actually work and of course some of them work better for some aspects than others okay
sometimes you can do it purely unsupervised some sometimes um you want to have supervised learning to be able
to do this sometimes you want to make these predictions and go and explicitly ask somebody to to
ask you ask you whether it's correct or not. 

### Typological databases

There's a number of these typological databases out there walls is only one it's quite good it's quite famous and there's a number [Music]
been derived from those or derived from multiple ones especially to fill in particular aspects of the features and
these can be really useful in trying to do things when you're doing multilingual um modeling because you want to know
maybe these features make a difference on my downstream or my predicted prediction task
and i like to be able to get these features I'd like to have reliable features i'd like to know when the features are confident
when the features are missing when the features are um going to be more important than others so that maybe I look harder to be able to find these features here at cmu a number of years ago we had

### lorelai

A project called lorelai which we'll mention a few times in this um course where we actually tried to build a
specific vector that tries to represent a language so lang to vec so given the
name of the language given the code of a language we'll give a vector representation that will try to um
identify all of the aspects that would be relevant for feeding in as a prior when you're building um various language models okay um there was a bunch of work
done on this to be able to do this um basically both building the vector and also trying to predict and and across
that there are still people doing phd's graham is still very much working in that way and
aditi is our phd is very much in that space um

### Universals

are there any unit universals that are features that are there for everything for all possible languages and the
answer is yes mostly and sometimes there's a little bit caveats around the edge and
so for example all languages do seem to have vowels and consonants but the definition that the boundary for vowels
and consonants isn't very good um so that's might be an easy thing to fulfill
but it seems to be true given that we're all using the same vocal tract that we are actually trying to do that
almost all languages have got nouns and verbs now there's some languages where the distinction isn't very strong and
it's morphological variants that allow you to be able to distinguish between it but pretty much everything has nouns and
verbs now once you get the adjectives the next major class that's not so clear and we end up with a
number of languages that will use nouns as adjectives maybe with some morphological variation in english you
can get away with quite complex nouns being used as adjectival forms
more so in american english than in british english and but that's sort of moved to that we get quite complex noun
compounds which are really some form of adjectival form and that's true across a number of languages now there's other
things that are very common across multiple language families or related
languages that are relatively interesting and identifiable
and there are multiple non-related languages that will do that you know species between um words in the written
form um a morphology that's um segmental so we're joining things
together as opposed to um templatic morphology where you have maybe a bunch of different um consonants
and the vowels change inside it arabic and hebrew and a number of other northern
african and languages have that that are not necessarily all in the semitic language family and so there's a number
of things that are relatively common but they're not going to be everywhere but you know there's also things about you
know um uh if language is distinguished between voiced and unvoiced they don't always um
they're going to care more about the voice than the unvoiced ones um how do we deal with the low repo low

### low resource languages

resource aspect of this how can we actually find out um how if we were given a language and we maybe only got a
few features for it how can we predict other things for it well we can look at all other languages that are similar and
we can find out well most languages of these features have got those features and we might also say
for that language what's the most related language and we'll just say well let's assume all these features it might
not be true but it's probably better than just assuming everything is english because everything is certainly not
english okay and the number of different groups and throughout the um world have been studying this is quite a
major area of looking at how to be able to predict or get other features for low
resource languages when you don't have data that's there now there's a number of different ways of doing such
multilingual nlp what you can do is you can say well i'm going to try to find
a close by language and i'm just going to assume everything about that and maybe remove things that are not
appropriate and often that happens so imagine that um you come to europe and
um there's this island nation that separated itself from the rest of europe
uh pretending that it's not part of europe at all and nobody knows anything about english and eventually somebody
braved the channel and gets to england how might they understand english and the answer is well it seems sort of
germanic-like so let's just pretend it's german or dutch um which is even closer
and then just use everything that we have um from the dutch language to apply it to english and maybe train a little
from that and you would get much further with that than if you took chinese or
hindi or maybe even french although a lot of the words are borrowed from french and but the grammar um is very much germanic
in english so we take another language and try to do things so what we're doing is taking an existing model and then trying to
fine-tune it for the target for okay another way to do this is to try to take

### multilingual birth

all languages or all languages in some language family and what we would then do is we would then train everything
together in some multiple joint way there's lots of different ways of doing that and then we would have a model that
was multilingual in a true sense that's actually how multilingual birth is done rather than having different births from
different languages and then doing adaptations of the target one we actually build a multi-lingual bar and
then we've got this multilingual thing so it's sharing some information about all of these languages and that might
make it easier when you're doing adaptation to the target one form and that is an open question okay um it
probably depends on the amount of training data and the amount of languages and how close it is and whether it's going to be similar or not
to these other languages when you're doing that whether you have a writing system that's the same whether it's different whether phrenology is
different and all these things are going to be important so there won't be one answer for everything but you should be
aware of the different ways of actually trying to do that okay um why do we care about um typology at

### why typology

all can't we just well we're going to train from everything um and the answer basically is for most low resource
languages you just don't have enough data and even if you pretend that you have enough data it's been shown in
english the more data you have the better your models are going to be now in general in machine learning the more
structured data you have the easier it is to be able to learn things so if you have external data to help you when
you're dealing with small amounts of data it will usually not always but it will usually learn better so knowing
about the default word order knowing whether morphology is an issue or not knowing the types of grammatical
structures the types of verb structures the types of noun structures or their noun classes or their politeness these
will potentially help you when you're building your model to be able to get better results quicker okay

### how to choose a transfer language

> How do you choose a transfer language?
> Well often what people will do is they'll go and ask some um a
knowledgeable person about which language is close and you'll get an answer but that might not always be the right answer and there was a bunch of
work done here um a few years ago and trying to look at that for particular tasks like
translation and there's non-trivial aspects of actual similarity of the language reliability of the language the
amount of data that you have and whether the data on the domain of the data that you have is appropriate is it
conversational um is it newspaper text is it bible text and um the linux all
people actually did quite a lot of that to try to do it i remember the sort of default answer for that
i am right about this i think it's this one and said turkish by default is the best one over everything and that's sort
of probably because turkish is fairly well resourced it's influenced by a lot of different other language families so
it has arabic it has english it has um iranian and hindi farsi um
sanskrit and things in it and it spreads over there's a vast amount of um the world going from europe all the
way into turkic languages all the way into china open research problems that we have.

### open research problems

> How to extract typological features automatically so if you give me a language can i find out the default word
order that's sort of hard i mean we're gonna get some there but but when the
it's not obvious and maybe it's different in written form compared to in the spoken form and therefore you have
to be able to care for that but there is this thing called the universal dependency tree bank that um originally
came out of google and so there are these um existing toolkits and data sets which
try to give this information for many of the major languages and some of the minor language as well and these
resources are hard to do yourself and therefore it's always good to know about them and to be able to build on top of
them okay um there's lots of other things that are

## Multilingual aspects

out there if you want to learn about morphology or phonology you can look at multilingual aspects in the um in the
computational linguistics and conferences there's lots of geographical groups that are looking at say
specifically looking at um indian languages african languages um
there are lots of things that are looking at low resource languages there are lots of ones looking at interesting morphology languages and so often it's
worth looking at and though everybody who doesn't know a language thinks i'll just train from an infinite amount of
data the answer is well you won't have an infinite amount of data and sometimes it's quite hard to find data and if you
discover that morphology is rich in the particular language it might be worth doing morphological segmentation and
there may already be an existing morphological analyzer that's there or at least help to be able to find that
okay so that's a very quick view of um typology on how we actually structure
languages um and it's becoming more and more important in the computational form than what it was been before um
10 15 years ago you'd see less papers about it but now people are really caring about it because we are doing
much more multilingual work you were asked to read this particular paper which was a survey paper on
looking at aspects of um typology across um different people trying to do
predictions and how well they were actually doing and the issues that are involved in this and what we're going to
do now is we're going to split you off into groups and um in those groups you'll have a ta or
an instructor will be there and um what we want you to do is we want you
each of you um to identify things which are
unique or very rare compared to other languages that are important over the
languages you know um in distinct from things which are not
very interesting maybe whole classes of languages that are unrelated are all using a romanized form and to write them
um but they're not related but things that are going to be unique from that point of view now um a
has someone set up the groups graham have you set up the groups have um maybe we could take some
questions if people had questions yes sure
yes thank you 22 uh indian languages yeah
yeah so what language you write things in is quite interesting and especially once you're in a code switching space
um in india almost everybody when they're code switching will write in a romanized form they'll often call it
english but it's not english it's the romanized form so they're writing both hindi in a romanized form and english in
romanesque form while when you look at um singapore for example where people can
be um as fluent in chinese and english they actually use hansi for writing
chinese and english for writing english words most of that's got to do with input
method actually um it's like how easy is it to type these things on a computer
and for historical reasons actually partly because there was less chinese
speakers who spoke english the chinese input systems became better while in india for the past 200 years
the educated elite were all english-speaking and therefore they were used to reading and writing in using
romanized m form probably that's got something to do with it but definitely information is lost
when you may be using a non-native um script and for example spelling goes on
completely out of the way in english when you're doing it but remember most written most scripts are not appropriate
for the language we are using a latin script for a germanic english in
english we use kanji in japanese for writing lots of things and yeah there's other scripts in japanese
for dealing with more native things um and um hangul is native in korea but
there's still lots of um chinese borrowed words especially scientific words
um that come from chinese and so often the writing system even for the native
speakers is not very appropriate but often it's just convention it's like this is the way we write it and we've
always written it and it was only since last year that people live but they think it's facts that we've done it forever
you know basically we've always sent dances to tiktok as a way to communicate and i can't remember when
when we ever did anything else
