In both case though the authors are interested in the ability of the neural network to use the wghiets that it has learned to process a long sequence of test and put together a coherent output based on distant and often sparse parts of the input. In a named entity recognition task the network has a fairly simple task to do - it needs to classify a few token based a few cues from the immediate context.
