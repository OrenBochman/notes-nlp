## Overview {#sec-overview}

![week-3](img/V1-001-week-3.png){.column-margin group="slides"}
In this week we are going to learn about **transfer learning**.
More specifically we will understand how **T5** and **BERT** actually work.

![question-answering](img/V1-002-question-answering.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

::: {.callout-note}
## Definitions:

Q&A comes in two forms:

context based
	: given a document and a question the model extracts an answer or generates an answer
 
closed book
	: the model picks an answer from several options (classifier)

![transfer-learning-tasks](img/V1-006-transfer-learning-tasks.png){.column-margin group="slides"}
We can see how a model initially trained on some type of sentiment classification, could now be used for question answering. One other model that has state of the art makes use of multi tasking. 
For example, the same model could be used for sentiment analysis, question answering, and many other things.

![goals](img/V1-007-goals.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

These new types of models make use of a lot of data. For example the C4 (colossal cleaned crawled corpus) is about 800 GB when all of the english wikipedia is just 13 GB! 

> C4 is a colossal, cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. It was based on [Common Crawl dataset](https://commoncrawl.org). It was used to train the T5 text-to-text Transformer models.
> Introduced by @raffel2023exploringlimitstransferlearning  in  a paper titled "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer"

![tl-summary](img/V2-020-tl-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

There are three main advantages to transfer learning:

* Reduce training time
* Improve predictions
* Allows we to use smaller datasets

Two methods that we can use for transfer learning are the following:

- pre-training
- fine tuning

In **feature based**, we can train word embeddings by running a different model and then using those features (i.e. word vectors) on a different task. 
When **fine tuning**, we can use the exact same model and just run it on a different task. Sometimes when fine tuning, we can keep the model weights fixed and just add a new layer that we will train. Other times we can slowly unfreeze the layers one at a time. We can also use unlabelled data when pre-training, by masking words and trying to predict which word was masked.

For example, in the drawing above we try to predict the word "friend". This allows your model to get a grasp of the overall structure of the data and to help the model learn some relationships within the words of a sentence


## ELMo, GPT, BERT, T5 {#sec-video3-elmo-gpt-bert-t5}

![outline](img/V3-030-outline.png){.column-margin group="slides"}
<hr>

![CBOW-fixed-window](img/V3-031-cbow-fixed-window.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


The models mentioned in the previous video were discovered in the following order. 

- CBOW in Word2Vec - Issue: Fixed window we want all the context
  - 2013 Word2Vec Google
  - CBOW & Skip grams	
  - 2014 Glove Stanfor [GloVe: Global Vectors for Word ()]()
- ElMo - Bidirectional LSTM 
  - Solves: fixed window size using a biderectional RNN
  - Issue:  weak long term dependency
- GPT2 - issue: unidirectional. only looks back
- BERT - just encoder - biderctional, multi mask learning
- T5 - Encoder Decoder - multi-task learning

## CBOW

![CBOW-issues](img/V3-032-cbow-issues.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![ELMo-solution](img/V3-033-elmo-solution.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![BERT](img/V3-036-bert.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![multi-mask](img/V3-037-multi-mask.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![BERT-pre-training](img/V3-038-BERT-pre-training.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


![t5-encoder-decoder](img/V3-039-t5-encoder-decoder.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

In CBOW, we want to encode a word as a vector. To do this we used the context before the word and the context after the word and we use that model to learn and creates features for the word. CBOW however uses a fixed window C (for the context).

the main isused with CBOW are:

- it has a fixed window size
- no concept of order

so what do we do when we need more context to model the concept we are looking at?

What ElMo does,  it uses a bi-directional LSTM, which is a version of an RNN that looks at the inputs from the left and the right.
This has the added benefit that the context size is no longer constrained. 
But since it is an RNN it has problems propagating information as sequences grow longer.


Then Open AI introduced GPT. GPT unfortunately is uni-directional but it makes use of transformers. 
Although ElMo was bi-directional, it suffered from some issues such as capturing longer-term dependencies. 

BERT was then introduced which stands for the Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers.

T5 was introduced which makes use of transfer learning and uses the same model to predict on many tasks.

- GPT was a transformer decoder
- BERT was a transformer encoder
- T5 is a decoder encoder

![t5-text-to-text](img/V3-041-t5-text-to-text.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

Here is an illustration of how T5 works:

![question](img/V3-042-question.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


![summary](img/V3-043-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

So we can now flesh out the table

## BERT Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers {#sec-video4-bert}

![BERT-outline](img/V4-050-bert-outline.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![BERT-question](img/V4-050-bert-question.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


![BERT-summary](img/V4-050-bert-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

lets dive deeper into BERT

There are two steps in the BERT framework: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks.  For fine tuning, the BERT model is first initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks. For example, in the figure above, we get the corresponding embeddings for the input words, we run it through a few transformer blocks, and then we make the prediction at each time point $T_i$.

Training procedures:

- Choose 15% of the tokens at random:
  - mask them 80% of the time, 
  - replace them with a random token 10% of the time, 
  - keep as is 10% of the time.
There could be multiple masked spans in a sentence.
Next sentence prediction is also used when pre-training.

![BERT](img/V4-051-bert.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![BERT-spec](img/V4-052-bert-spec.png){.column-margin group="slides"}
 
 Spec and features:

![BERT-pre-training](img/V4-053-bert-pre-training.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

## BERT Objective {#sec-video5-bert-objective}

![BERT-outline](img/V5-060-BERT-outline.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

MLM - masked language modeling.

This is the main unsupervised  procedure to train the model with context left and right.
It's not clear how the model handles multiple masked items. 

Does it try to predict them all at once or each one by considering input as context and unknowns.

![BERT-the-input](img/V5-061-BERT-the-input.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmentation embeddings and the position embeddings.
The input embeddings: we have a CLS token to indicate the beginning of the sentence and a sep to indicate the end of the sentence
The segment embeddings: allows we to indicate whether it is sentence a or b.
Positional embeddings: allows we to indicate the word's position in the sentence.

![BERT-the-output](img/V5-062-BERT-the-output.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

The C token in the image above could be used for classification purposes. The unlabeled sentence A/B pair will depend on what we are trying to predict, it could range from question answering to sentiment. (in which case the second sentence could be just empty). 

![BERT-objectives](img/V5-063-BERT-objectives.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

The BERT objective is defined as follows: 


![BERT-summary](img/V5-064-BERT-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

## Fine tuning BERT {#sec-video6-fine-tuning-bert}

![BERT-fine-tuning-outline](img/V6-070-BERT-fine-tuning-outline.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

Once we have a pre-trained model, we can fine tune it on different tasks. 


![inputs](img/V6-071-inputs.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

For example, given a hypothesis, we can identify the premise. Given a question, we can find the answer. We can also use it for named entity recognition. Here is a summary of the inputs.

- We can replace sentences A/B
- Paraphrase from sentence A
- Question/passage
- Hypothesis premise pairs in entailment
- Text and a Ø for classification/sequence tagging
- Output tokens are fed into a layer for token level tasks otherwise use [CLS] embedding as input.


![summary](img/V6-072-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


## Transformer: T5

![t5-outline](img/V7-073-t5-outline.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![t5-text-to-text](img/V7-074-t5-text-to-text.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![T5-transformer](img/V7-075-T5-transformer.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


One of the major techniques that allowed the T5 model to reach state of the art is the concept of masking:

For example, we represent the "for inviting" with $<X>$ and last with $<Y>$ then the model predicts what the X should be and what the Y should be. This is exactly what we saw in the BERT loss. We can also mask out a few positions, not just one. The loss is only on the mask for BERT, for T5 it is on the target. 


![T5-architecture](img/V7-076-T5-architecture.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

So we start with the basic encoder-decoder representation.  There we have a fully visible attention in the encoder and then causal attention in the decoder.  So light gray lines correspond to causal masking. And dark gray lines correspond to the fully visible masking. 

In the middle we have the language model which consists of a single transformer layer stack. And it's being fed the concatenation of the inputs and the target. So it uses causal masking throughout as we can see because they're all gray lines. And we have $X_1$ going inside, we get $X_2$, $X_2$ goes into the model and we get $X3$ and so forth. 

To the right, we have prefix language model which corresponds to allowing fully visible masking over the inputs as we can see with the dark arrows. And then causal masking in the rest.


## Lecture Multi-Task Training Strategy {#sec-video8-multi-task-training-strategy}

![T5-architecture](img/V8-080-T5-architecture.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![T5-summary](img/V8-081-T5-summary.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![T5-multi-task-training](img/V8-082-T5-multi-task-training.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

This is a reminder of how the T5 model works:

We can see that we only have to add a small prefix to the input and the model as a result will solve the task for you. There are many tasks that the t5 model can do for you.
It is possible to formulate most NLP tasks in a “text-to-text” format – that is, a task where the model is fed some text for context or conditioning and is then asked to produce some output text. This framework provides a consistent training objective both for pre-training and fine-tuning. Specifically, the model is trained with a maximum likelihood objective (using “teacher forcing” ) regardless of the task.

### Training data strategies {#sec-training-data-strategies}

Examples-proportional mixing
: sample in proportion to the size of each task’s dataset

Temperature scaled mixing
: adjust the "temperature”" of the mixing rates. This temperature parameter allows we to weight certain examples more than others. To implement temperature scaling with temperature T, we raise each task’s mixing rate rm to the power of 1⁄T and renormalize the rates so that they sum to 1. When T = 1, this approach is equivalent to examples-proportional mixing and as T increases the proportions become closer to equal mixing

Equal mixing
: In this case, we sample examples from each task with equal probability. Specifically, each example in each batch is sampled uniformly at random from one of the datasets we train on.


![io-format](img/V8-083-io-format.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![multi-task-training](img/V8-084-multi-task-training.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![unfreezing-adapter-layers](img/V8-086-unfreezing-adapter-layers.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![question](img/V8-087-question.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![fine-tuning](img/V8-088-fine-tuning.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

We can see how fine tuning on a specific task could work even though we were pre-training on different tasks.

## GLUE Benchmark {#sec-video9-glue-benchmark}

![GLUE-evaluation](img/V9-090-GLUE-evaluation.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![GLUE-tasks](img/V9-091-GLUE-tasks.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![GLUE](img/V9-092-GLUE.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) is contains: 

* A collection used to train, evaluate, analyze natural language understanding systems
* Datasets with different genres, and of different sizes and difficulties
* Leaderboard

Currently T5 is state of the art according to this GLUE benchmark and  we will be implementing it for homework this week! This GLUE bench mark is used for research purposes, it is model agnostic, and relies on models that make use of transfer learning.

## Question Answering {#sec-video10-question-answering}

![BERT-feed-forward-block](img/V9-093-BERT-feed-forward-block.png){.column-margin group="slides"}
We will be implementing an encoder this week. Last week we implemented the decoder. So here it is: 

![BERT-encoder-Block](img/V9-094-BERT-encoder-Block.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![BERT-blocks](img/V9-095-BERT-blocks.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![q&a-data-example](img/V9-096-q&a-data-example.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![q&a-with-t5](img/V9-097-q&a-with-t5.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![t5](img/V9-098-t5.png){.column-margin group="slides"}

![t5-question](img/V9-099-t5-question.png){.column-margin group="slides"}


We can see there is a feed forward and the encoder-block above. It makes use of two residual connections, layer normalization, and dropout. 

The steps we will follow to implement it are:

- Load a pre-trained model
- Process data to get the required inputs and outputs: "question: Q context: C" as input and "A" as target
- Fine tune your model on the new task and input 
- Predict using your own model

- 2017 fasttext Facebook CBOW 
  - morphological via sub words
	Algorithm of fasttext is based on these two papers:[8]
  - Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information , Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin and Tomas Mikolov, 2016
  - Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification, Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, Piotr Bojanowski, Tomas Mikolov, 2016
- 2018 ELMO Allen Institute for AI	ELMo - 
	Character based
	Bidirectional LSTM - 
	Issue: long term dependency is weak due to vanishing gradient and information loss.
- GPT 	Encoder only with left context
- Bert	uses 
- 2020 T5	uses a label to specify task
	uses task specific bidirectional lstm to build the embeddings
- BERT 	Decoder only

Input Token embedding - the distributed representation of the tokens in one space S  with Dim(S)=D
	
	Segment embedding - because the model cannot tell the segment apart
	
	Position embedding because the model cannot discriminate the word position. 

Note we are trying to mimic RNN behavior but we don't have recursion:

Note these are added - they all live in S.
	Question: would putting S and P in their own dimensions more interpretable.
	Questions: how do we know the model does not have embeddings that are similar to E_A  and E_0
	Output
	CLS - classification token
	SEP - separator token
convert to embedding
C  is used for next sentence prediction
T_i are used for masked word prediction
T 	
	
	Cross entropy loss + Binary loss
	
	cross entropy loss to compare between two distribution from Softmax
	
	binary loss - could use cross entropy on two cat.
	Pretraining
        	before feeding data we mask 15% of the tokens.
	mask 80% of the time:
	training data generator chooses 15%. of these at random for prediction
	replace with:
	mask .8 of the time a random word .1 of the time
	original world otherwise.
	
	a sentence may have multiple masks.
	
	next sentence prediction also used in pre training.

T5	like BERT does  Transfer learning + fine tuning.
	classification, MT, NE, Sentiment
	
	 
	So we can see over here we have fully visible attention in the encoder and then causal attention in the decoder. 
	And then we have the general encoder-decoder representation just as 
	notation. 
	So light gray lines correspond to causal masking. 
	And dark gray lines correspond to the fully visible masking. 
	So on the left as I said again, it's the standard encoder-decoder architecture. 
	In the middle over here what we have, 
	we have the language model which consists of a single transformer layer stack. 
	And it's being fed the concatenation of the inputs and the target. 
	So it uses causal masking throughout as we can see because they're 
	all gray lines. 
	And we have X1 going inside over here, get at X2, 
	X2 goes into the model X3 and so forth. 
	Now over here to the right, 
	we have prefix language model which corresponds to allowing fully 
	visible masking over the inputs as we can see here in the dark arrows. 
	And then causal masking in the rest.
	Play video starting at :3:2 and follow transcript3:02
	So as we can see over here, it's doing causal masking. 
	So the model architecture, it uses encoder/decoder stack. 
	It has 12 transformer blocks each. 
	So we can think of it as a dozen eggs and then 220 million parameters. 
	So in summary, you've seen prefix language model attention. 
	You've seen the model architecture for T5. 
	And you've seen how the pre-training is done similar to birds, but 
	we just use mask language modeling here.
	
	
	encoder/decoder
1212 transformer blocks
220 million parameters
