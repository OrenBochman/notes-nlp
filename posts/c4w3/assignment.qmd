## Honor code alert

Due to the Coursera Honor Code, I cannot provide the solutions to the assignments. 

- This notebook is the original notebook provided by the course
- It is setup to run without stopping for errors. 
- It is also likely to be out of date as the course has had some updates since I took it.
- Although I aced the course this assignment was the most time consuming.
- Good luck with the assignment it should make we a better programmer.
- It is also a good idea to go over it a few times until we can do it easily.
:::


Welcome to this week's assignment of course 4. In this you will explore question answering. You will implement the "Text to Text Transfer from Transformers" (better known as T5). Since you implemented transformers from scratch last week you will now be able to use them.

### Overview {#0}

This assignment will be different from the two previous ones. Due to memory and time constraints of this environment you will not be able to train a model and use it for inference. Instead you will create the necessary building blocks for the transformer encoder model and will use a pretrained version of the same model in two ungraded labs after this assignment.

After completing these 3 (1 graded and 2 ungraded) labs you will:
* Implement the code necessary for Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT).
* Understand how the C4 dataset is structured.
* Use a pretrained model for inference.
* Understand how the "Text to Text Transfer from Transformers" or T5 model works. 


## Part 0: Importing the Packages {#01}

```{python}
#| colab: {base_uri: https://localhost:8080/, height: 34}
#| colab_type: code
import ast
import string
import textwrap
import itertools
import numpy as np

import trax 
from trax import layers as tl
from trax.supervised import decoding

# Will come handy later.
wrapper = textwrap.TextWrapper(width=70)

# Set random seed
np.random.seed(42)
```

## Part 1: C4 Dataset {#1}

The [C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) is a huge data set. For the purpose of this assignment you will use a few examples out of it which are present in `data.txt`. C4 is based on the [common crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) project. Feel free to read more on their website. 

Run the cell below to see how the examples look like. 

```{python}
# load example jsons
example_jsons = list(map(ast.literal_eval, open('data.txt')))

# Printing the examples to see how the data looks like
for i in range(5):
    print(f'example number {i+1}: \n\n{example_jsons[i]} \n')
```

Notice the `b` before each string? This means that this data comes as bytes rather than strings. Strings are actually lists of bytes so for the rest of the assignments the name `strings` will be used to describe the data. 

To check this run the following cell:

```{python}
type(example_jsons[0].get('text'))
```


###  1.1 Pre-Training Objective {#1.1}

**Note:** The word "mask" will be used throughout this assignment in context of hiding/removing word(s)

You will be implementing the BERT loss as shown in the following image. 

![loss](img/loss.png){width="600" height="400"}

Assume you have the following text:

[**Thank you [for inviting]{style = "color:red"} me to your party [last]{style = "color:red"}  week**]{style = "color:blue"}


Now as input you will mask the words in red in the text: 

[**Input:**]{style = "color:blue"} Thank you  **X** me to your party **Y** week.

[**Output:**]{style = "color:blue"} The model should predict the words(s) for **X** and **Y**. 

**Z** is used to represent the end.

### 1.2 Process C4 {#1.2}

C4 only has the plain string `text` field, so you will tokenize and have `inputs` and `targets` out of it for supervised learning. Given your inputs, the goal is to predict the targets during training. 

You will now take the `text` and convert it to `inputs` and `targets`.

```{python}
# Grab text field from dictionary
natural_language_texts = [example_json['text'] for example_json in example_jsons]
```

```{python}
# First text example
natural_language_texts[4]
```


#### 1.2.1 Decode to natural language {#1.2.1}

The following functions will help you `detokenize` and`tokenize` the text data.  

The `sentencepiece` vocabulary was used to convert from text to ids. This vocabulary file is loaded and used in this helper functions.

`natural_language_texts` has the text from the examples we gave you. 

Run the cells below to see what is going on. 

```{python}
# Special tokens
PAD, EOS, UNK = 0, 1, 2

def detokenize(np_array):
    return trax.data.detokenize(
        np_array,
        vocab_type='sentencepiece',
        vocab_file='sentencepiece.model',
        vocab_dir='.')

def tokenize(s):
  # The trax.data.tokenize function operates on streams,
  # that's why we have to create 1-element stream with iter
  # and later retrieve the result with next.
    return next(trax.data.tokenize(
        iter([s]),
        vocab_type='sentencepiece',
        vocab_file='sentencepiece.model',
        vocab_dir='.'))
```

```{python}
# printing the encoding of each word to see how subwords are tokenized
tokenized_text = [(tokenize(word).tolist(), word) for word in natural_language_texts[0].split()]
print(tokenized_text, '\n')
```

```{python}
# We can see that detokenize successfully undoes the tokenization
print(f"tokenized: {tokenize('Beginners')}\ndetokenized: {detokenize(tokenize('Beginners'))}")
```

As you can see above, you were able to take a piece of string and tokenize it. 

Now you will create `input` and `target` pairs that will allow you to train your model. T5 uses the ids at the end of the vocab file as sentinels. For example, it will replace: 
   - `vocab_size - 1` by `<Z>`
   - `vocab_size - 2` by `<Y>`
   - and so forth. 
   
It assigns every word a `chr`.

The `pretty_decode` function below, which you will use in a bit, helps in handling the type when decoding. Take a look and try to understand what the function is doing.

Notice that:

```python
string.ascii_letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
```

**NOTE:** Targets may have more than the 52 sentinels we replace, but this is just to give you an idea of things.

```{python}
vocab_size = trax.data.vocab_size(
    vocab_type='sentencepiece',
    vocab_file='sentencepiece.model',
    vocab_dir='.')

def get_sentinels(vocab_size=vocab_size, display=False):
    sentinels = {}
    for i, char in enumerate(reversed(string.ascii_letters), 1):
        decoded_text = detokenize([vocab_size - i]) 
        
        # Sentinels, ex: <Z> - <a>
        sentinels[decoded_text] = f'<{char}>'    
    
        if display:
            print(f'The sentinel is <{char}> and the decoded token is:', decoded_text)

    return sentinels
```

```{python}
sentinels = get_sentinels(vocab_size, display=True)
```

```{python}
def pretty_decode(encoded_str_list, sentinels=sentinels):
    # If already a string, just do the replacements.
    if isinstance(encoded_str_list, (str, bytes)):
        for token, char in sentinels.items():
            encoded_str_list = encoded_str_list.replace(token, char)
        return encoded_str_list
  
    # We need to decode and then prettyfy it.
    return pretty_decode(detokenize(encoded_str_list))
```

```{python}
pretty_decode("I want to dress up as an Intellectual this halloween.")
```

The functions above make your `inputs` and `targets` more readable. For example, you might see something like this once you implement the masking function below. 

- [Input sentence:]{style="color:red"} Younes and Lukasz were working together in the lab yesterday after lunch. 
- [Input:]{style="color:red"} Younes and Lukasz  **Z** together in the **Y** yesterday after lunch.
- [Target:]{style="color:red"} **Z** were working **Y** lab.

### 1.3 Tokenizing and Masking {#1.3}

You will now implement the `tokenize_and_mask` function. This function  will allow you to tokenize and mask input words with a noise probability. We usually mask 15% of the words.

### Exercise 01 {#ex01}

```{python}
# UNQ_C1
# GRADED FUNCTION: tokenize_and_mask
def tokenize_and_mask(text, vocab_size=vocab_size, noise=0.15, 
                      randomizer=np.random.uniform, tokenize=tokenize):
    """Tokenizes and masks a given input.

    Args:
        text (str or bytes): Text input.
        vocab_size (int, optional): Size of the vocabulary. Defaults to vocab_size.
        noise (float, optional): Probability of masking a token. Defaults to 0.15.
        randomizer (function, optional): Function that generates random values. Defaults to np.random.uniform.
        tokenize (function, optional): Tokenizer function. Defaults to tokenize.

    Returns:
        tuple: Tuple of lists of integers associated to inputs and targets.
    """
    
    # current sentinel number (starts at 0)
    cur_sentinel_num = 0
    # inputs
    inps = []
    # targets
    targs = []
    
    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' WITH YOUR CODE) ###
    
    # prev_no_mask is True if the previous token was NOT masked, False otherwise
    # set prev_no_mask to True
    prev_no_mask = None
    
    # loop through tokenized `text`
    for token in tokenize(text):
        # check if the `noise` is greater than a random value (weighted coin flip)
        if randomizer() < noise:
            # check to see if the previous token was not masked
            if prev_no_mask==True: # add new masked token at end_id
                # number of masked tokens increases by 1
                cur_sentinel_num += None
                # compute `end_id` by subtracting current sentinel value out of the total vocabulary size
                end_id = None - None
                # append `end_id` at the end of the targets
                targs.append(None)
                # append `end_id` at the end of the inputs
                inps.append(None)
            # append `token` at the end of the targets
            targs.append(None)
            # set prev_no_mask accordingly
            prev_no_mask = None
        
        else: # don't have two masked tokens in a row
            # append `token ` at the end of the inputs
            inps.append(None)
            # set prev_no_mask accordingly
            prev_no_mask = None
            
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return inps, targs

        cyclic_vals = itertools.cycle(vals)

            yield next(cyclic_vals)

    dumr = itertools.cycle(dummy_generator())

    def dummy_randomizer():

#### **Expected Output:**

```CPP

tokenized inputs:

[31999, 15068, 4501, 3, 12297, 3399, 16, 5964, 7115, 31998, 531, 25, 241, 12, 129, 394, 44, 492, 31997, 58, 148, 56, 43, 8, 1004, 6, 474, 31996, 39, 4793, 230, 5, 2721, 6, 1600, 1630, 31995, 1150, 4501, 15068, 16127, 6, 9137, 2659, 5595, 31994, 782, 3624, 14627, 15, 12612, 277, 5, 216, 31993, 2119, 3, 9, 19529, 593, 853, 21, 921, 31992, 12, 129, 394, 28, 70, 17712, 1098, 5, 31991, 3884, 25, 762, 25, 174, 12, 214, 12, 31990, 3, 9, 3, 23405, 4547, 15068, 2259, 6, 31989, 6, 5459, 6, 13618, 7, 6, 3604, 1801, 31988, 6, 303, 24190, 11, 1472, 251, 5, 37, 31987, 36, 16, 8, 853, 19, 25264, 399, 568, 31986, 21, 21380, 7, 34, 19, 339, 5, 15746, 31985, 8, 583, 56, 36, 893, 3, 9, 3, 31984, 9486, 42, 3, 9, 1409, 29, 11, 25, 31983, 12246, 5977, 13, 284, 3604, 24, 19, 2657, 31982]

targets:

[31999, 12847, 277, 31998, 9, 55, 31997, 3326, 15068, 31996, 48, 30, 31995, 727, 1715, 31994, 45, 301, 31993, 56, 36, 31992, 113, 2746, 31991, 216, 56, 31990, 5978, 16, 31989, 379, 2097, 31988, 11, 27856, 31987, 583, 12, 31986, 6, 11, 31985, 26, 16, 31984, 17, 18, 31983, 56, 36, 31982, 5]
```

You will now use the inputs and the targets from the `tokenize_and_mask` function you implemented above. Take a look at the masked sentence using your `inps` and `targs` from the sentence above. 

```{python}
#| colab: {base_uri: https://localhost:8080/, height: 105}
#| colab_type: code
print('Inputs: \n\n', pretty_decode(inps))
print('\nTargets: \n\n', pretty_decode(targs))
```



### 1.4 Creating the Pairs {#1.4}

You will now create pairs using your dataset. You will iterate over your data and create (inp, targ) pairs using the functions that we have given you. 

```{python}
# Apply tokenize_and_mask
inputs_targets_pairs = [tokenize_and_mask(text) for text in natural_language_texts]
```

```{python}
#| colab: {base_uri: https://localhost:8080/, height: 1000}
#| colab_type: code
def display_input_target_pairs(inputs_targets_pairs):
    for i, inp_tgt_pair in enumerate(inputs_targets_pairs, 1):
        inps, tgts = inp_tgt_pair
        inps, tgts = pretty_decode(inps), pretty_decode(tgts)
        print(f'[{i}]\n\n'
              f'inputs:\n{wrapper.fill(text=inps)}\n\n'
              f'targets:\n{wrapper.fill(text=tgts)}\n\n\n\n')
```

```{python}
display_input_target_pairs(inputs_targets_pairs)
```

# Part 2: Transfomer {#2}

We now load a Transformer model checkpoint that has been pre-trained using the above C4 dataset and decode from it. This will save you a lot of time rather than have to train your model yourself. Later in this notebook, we will show you how to fine-tune your model.

![transformer](img/transformer.png){ width="300" height = "600" }


Start by loading in the model. We copy the checkpoint to local dir for speed, otherwise initialization takes a very long time. Last week you implemented the decoder part for the transformer. Now you will implement the encoder part. Concretely you will implement the following. 

![encoder](img/encoder.png){ width="300" height = "600" }

### 2.1 Transformer Encoder {#2.1}

You will now implement the transformer encoder. Concretely you will implement two functions. The first function is `FeedForwardBlock`.

#### 2.1.1 The Feedforward Block {#2.1.1}

The `FeedForwardBlock` function is an important one so you will start by implementing it. To do so, you need to return a list of the following: 

- [`tl.LayerNorm()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm) = layer normalization.
- [`tl.Dense(d_ff)`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) = fully connected layer.
- [`activation`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.activation_fns.Relu) = activation relu, tanh, sigmoid etc. 
- `dropout_middle` = we gave you this function (don't worry about its implementation).
- [`tl.Dense(d_model)`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) = fully connected layer with same dimension as the model.
- `dropout_final` = we gave you this function (don't worry about its implementation).

You can always take a look at [trax documentation](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if needed.

**Instructions**: Implement the feedforward part of the transformer. You will be returning a list. 

### Exercise 02 {#ex02}

```{python}
#| colab: {}
#| colab_type: code
# UNQ_C2
# GRADED FUNCTION: FeedForwardBlock
def FeedForwardBlock(d_model, d_ff, dropout, dropout_shared_axes, mode, activation):

        A list of layers which maps vectors to vectors.
    """
    
    dropout_middle = tl.Dropout(rate=dropout,
                                shared_axes=dropout_shared_axes, 
                                mode=mode)
  
    dropout_final = tl.Dropout(rate=dropout, 
                               shared_axes=dropout_shared_axes,

        # trax Layer normalization 
        None,
        # trax Dense layer using `d_ff`
        None,
        # activation() layer - you need to call (use parentheses) this func!
        None,
        # dropout middle layer
        None,
        # trax Dense layer using `d_model`
        None,
        # dropout final layer
        None,
    ]

```

```{python}
#| colab: {base_uri: https://localhost:8080/, height: 34}
#| colab_type: code
# Print the block layout
feed_forward_example = FeedForwardBlock(d_model=512, d_ff=2048, dropout=0.8, dropout_shared_axes=0, mode = 'train', activation = tl.Relu)
print(feed_forward_example)
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```CPP
 [LayerNorm, Dense_2048, Relu, Dropout, Dense_512, Dropout]
```

#### 2.1.2 The Encoder Block {#2.1.2}

The encoder block will use the `FeedForwardBlock`. 

You will have to build two residual connections. Inside the first residual connection you will have the `tl.layerNorm()`, `attention`, and `dropout_` layers. The second residual connection will have the `feed_forward`.  

You will also need to implement `feed_forward`, `attention` and `dropout_` blocks. 

So far you haven't seen the [`tl.Attention()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.Attention) and [`tl.Residual()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) layers so you can check the docs by clicking on them.

### 2.1.3 The Transformer Encoder {#2.1.3}

Now that you have implemented the `EncoderBlock`, it is time to build the full encoder. BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers is one such encoder. 

You will implement its core code in the function below by using the functions you have coded so far. 

The model takes in many hyperparameters, such as the `vocab_size`, the number of classes, the dimension of your model, etc. You want to build a generic function that will take in many parameters, so you can use it later. At the end of the day, anyone can just load in an API and call transformer, but we think it is important to make sure you understand how it is built. Let's get started. 

**Instructions:** For this encoder you will need a `positional_encoder` first (which is already provided) followed by `n_layers` encoder blocks, which are the same encoder blocks you previously built. Once you store the `n_layers` `EncoderBlock` in a list, you are going to encode a `Serial` layer with the following sublayers: 

- [`tl.Branch`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Branch): helps with the branching and has the following sublayers:
    - `positional_encoder`.
    - [`tl.PaddingMask()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.PaddingMask): layer that maps integer sequences to padding masks.
- Your list of `EncoderBlock`s
- [`tl.Select([0], n_in=2)`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select):  Copies, reorders, or deletes stack elements according to indices.
- [`tl.LayerNorm()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm).
- [`tl.Mean()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Mean): Mean along the first axis.
- `tl.Dense()` with n_units set to n_classes. 
- `tl.LogSoftmax()`   

Please refer to the [trax documentation](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for further information.

**NOTE Congratulations! You have completed all of the graded functions of this assignment.** Since the rest of the assignment takes a lot of time and memory to run we are providing some extra ungraded labs for you to see this model in action.

**Keep it up!**

To see this model in action continue to the next 2 ungraded labs. **We strongly recommend you to try the colab versions of them as they will yield a much smoother experience.** The links to the colabs can be found within the ungraded labs or if you already know how to open files within colab here are some shortcuts (if not, head to the ungraded labs which contain some extra instructions):
